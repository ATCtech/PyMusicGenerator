So... What do you think? 
 What do I do to ignore what's behind me? 
 Do I follow my fate to escape blindly? 
 Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams? 
 And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? 
 Do I let it go and try to stand it? 
 Or do I try to catch them red-handed? 
 Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness? 
 Or do I trust none and live life in loneliness? 
 Because sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men 
 I make the right turns but I'm lost within 
 I put on my daily facade but then 
 I just end up getting hurt again by myself (Myself!) 
 I ask why (But in my mind, I find) 
 I can't rely on myself (Myself!) 
 I ask why (But in my mind, I find) 
 I can't rely on myself 
 I can't hold on... 
 (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
 It's all too much to take in 
 I can't hold on 
 (Playing against you? I can't win!) 
 With thoughts of failure sinking in... 
 If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
 And to give in to fate seems senseless 
 If I hide my pride, I lie sleepless 
 And won't be able to cope with my weakness 
 If I let them go I'll be outdone 
 But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun 
 If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
 Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself (Myself!) 
 I ask why (But in my mind, I find) 
 I can't rely on myself (Myself!) 
 I ask why (But in my mind, I find) 
 I can't rely on myself 
 I can't hold on... 
 (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) 
 It's all too much to take in 
 I can't hold on 
 (Playing against you? I can't win!) 
 With thoughts of failure sinking in... 
 How do you think that I've lost so much? 
 Always afraid that I'm now out of touch 
 How do you expect I don't know what to do? 
 When all I know is what you tell me to... 
 Don't you (Know!) 
 I can't tell you how to make it (Go!) 
 No matter what I do, how hard I (Try!) 
 I can't seem to convince myself (Why?) 
 I'm stuck on the outside 
 Don't you (Know!) 
 I can't tell you how to make it (Go!) 
 No matter what I do, how hard I (Try!) 
 I can't seem to convince myself (Why?) 
 I'm stuck on the outside 
 I can't hold on...
