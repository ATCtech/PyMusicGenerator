Won't be long 'til everybody knows 
 I've seen her smiling 
 The sunlight is shining on her now 
 She couldn't stay here 
 She knows you won't let her down 
 You know she couldn't stay here with you 
 You know she had to go 
 Even though she couldn't stay here with you 
 You know you're not alone 
 No matter what you think you did wrong 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 She knew she had to go all along 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 No matter what you think you did wrong 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 She knew she had to go all along 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 I see her shining 
 The sunlight's crying for her now 
 She wouldn't stay here 
 She knows you won't let her down 
 You know she couldn't stay here with you 
 You know she had to go 
 Even though she couldn't stay here with you 
 You know you're not alone 
 No matter what you think you did wrong 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 She knew she had to go all along 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 No matter what you think you did wrong 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 She knew she had to go all along 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 Won't be long 'til everybody knows 
 Won't be long 'til everybody knows 
 Won't be long 'til everybody knows 
 Won't be long 'til everybody knows 
 No matter what you think you did wrong 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 She knew she had to go all along 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 No matter what you think you did wrong 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 She knew she had to go all along 
 (Won't be long 'til everybody knows) 
 No matter what you think you did wrong

 She knew she had to go all along
