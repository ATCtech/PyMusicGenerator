[Hydroponikz]: 
 I can't seem to focus, it's hopeless unless the sky opens 
 Look you in the eyes and all I see is a blur hoping 
 That my previous mindstate, could be resurrected 
 To the old me; it's like you had me injected with imperfection 
 How could you be so reckless? I initially meant it 
 Seems like you put your effort into me, what am I left with? 
 Nothin' but a canvas with a black and white portrait 
 Of me and you, in a burnin' garden of scorchin' orchards 
 Simple beauty that's bein torn down by your power 
 That constantly pounds on my soul hour after hour 
 Now I can hardly breathe, get rid of these memories 
 Continually haunting me, can't change who I've come to be 
 The darkness only ends as soon as you open your eyes 
 And you hope to realize that hope is cloaked in disguise 
 Again I look you in the eyes and all I see is a blur 
 But when I look in the mirror I can see who you were 
 [Chester Bennington (Linkin Park)]: 
 Nothing I can say or do 
 Will take away what I've been through 
 What you were is what I've come to be 
 Nothing you can say to me 
 Will take away these memories 
 What you were is what I've come to be! 
 (What I've come to be) 
 (x2) 
 The sky opens wide, to swallow me again, 
 Once I am inside, I'm lost and can't pretend 
 These pictures in my mind, are not a part of me 
 These memories hold me tight, till I can hardly breathe 
 (I can hardly breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe...) (x2)) 
 I can hardly stop the memories 
 [Hydroponikz]: 
 (Hardly breathe) 
 (Memories) 
 (Haunting me) 
 (Come to be) 
 (x2) 
 Now I can hardly breathe 
 Get rid of these memories 
 Continually haunting me 
 Can't change who I've come to be 
 (x4) 
 [(Chester) / Hydroponikz]: 
 [(I can hardly breathe...) 
 Now I can hardly breathe 
 Get rid of these memories 
 Continually haunting me 
 Can't change who I've come to be (x2)] 
 (I can hardly stop the memories..) 
 Now I can hardly breathe 
 Change who I've come to see 
 (Chorus (Chester))
