I wanna be in another place 
 I hate when you say you don't understand 
 I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night 
 Shining with the light from the sun 
 The sun doesn't give the light to the moon 
 Assuming the moon's gonna owe it one 
 It makes me think of how you act to me 
 You do favors then rapidly 
 You just turn around and start asking me 
 About things that you want back from me 
 I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
 Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
 Find another place to feed your greed 
 While I find a place to rest 
 I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
 Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
 Find another place to feed your greed 
 While I find a place to rest. 
 I wanna be in another place 
 I hate when you say you don't understand 
 (You'll see it's not meant to be) 
 I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 I wanna be in another place 
 I hate when you say you don't understand 
 (You'll see it's not meant to be) 
 I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 I wanna... 
 Two, Two, Three, Three, Yo, Yo, Yo 
 Give me Energon to keep me calm 
 You and your mom, keep all the dram 
 Used to be a team, passed that baton 
 But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb 
 Take it to the john, your Babylon 
 Flushed down with the sound that you carry on 
 I don't really give a dang, you pissed on my lawn 
 Took a dump like a punk, now the battle's on 
 So sick of you stressing, sick of you fessing 
 Sick of you acting like I owe you some 
 Find another place tto feed your face 
 If you don't, we gon' bump, get it up here, crunk 
 Sick of you stressing, sick of you fessing 
 Sick of you acting like I owe you some 
 Find another place tto feed your face 
 If you don't, we gon' bump, get it up here, crunk 
 I wanna be in another place 
 I hate when you say you don't understand 
 (You'll see it's not meant to be) 
 I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 I wanna be in another place 
 I hate when you say you don't understand 
 (You'll see it's not meant to be) 
 I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
 A place for my head 
 You try to take the best of me 
 You try to take the best of me, go away 
 You try to take the best of me 
 You try to take the best of me, go away 
 You try to take the best of me 
 You try to take the best of me, go away 
 You try to take the best of me 
 You try to take the best... 
 Go! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of... 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! (Stay away from Me!) 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Go away, go, try to take the best of me! 
 Stay away from me! 
 They sound really tasty man

 Or do you want me to tell you the with you thing first? 
 We can work on pushing me away. 
 I tell you, Black Thought is gonna do his thing
