" 
 I hate you so much right now 
 " 
 Crawling in my skin 
 These wounds, they will not heal 
 Fear is powerful 
 Confusing what is real, oh... 
 There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface 
 Consuming, confusing 
 This lack of self control I find so overwhelming 
 Controlling... I can't seem 
 To find the strength within, my walls are closing in 
 (Without a sense of competence, and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take...) 
 I've felt this way before; So insecure... 
 Crawling in my skin 
 These wounds, they will not heal 
 Fear is powerful 
 Confusing what is real, oh... 
 Discomfort endlessly has laid itself upon me 
 Distracting, reacting 
 Against my will I stand beside my own reflection 
 It's haunting how I can't seem... 
 To find the strength within, my walls are closing in 
 (Without a sense of competence, and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take...) 
 I've felt this way before; So insecure... 
 Raindrops put the rhythm of the pavement 
 And drip from the blacktop into the basement 
 Traces of the rain pervade this to erase your hate 
 And take this from the fakeness 
 Raindrops put the rhythm of the pavement 
 And drip from the blacktop into the basement 
 Traces of the rain pervade this to erase your hate 
 And take this from the fakeness... 
 To find the strength within, my walls are closing in... 
 (Traces of the rain pervade this to erase your hate 
 And take this from the fakeness...) 
 I've felt this way before; So insecure... 
 Crawling in my skin 
 These wounds, they will not heal 
 Fear is powerful 
 Confusing what is real 
 Crawling in my skin 
 These wounds, they will not heal 
 Fear is powerful 
 Confusing what is real, oh...
