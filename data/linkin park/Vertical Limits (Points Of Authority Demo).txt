Forfeit the game, stop the talk show 
 Product of what, you're taught to know 
 Forfeit the game, 'cause tomorrow 
 When it's all done, you'll reap what you sow 
 You love the way I look at you 
 While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through 
 You take away if I give in 
 My life, my pride is broken 
 You like to think you're never wrong 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You have to act like you're someone 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You want someone to hurt like you 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You want to share what you've been through 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You love the things I say I'll do 
 The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you 
 You take away when I give in 
 My life, my pride is broken 
 You like to think you're never wrong 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You have to act like you're someone 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You want someone to hurt like you 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 You want to share what you've been through 
 (You live what you've learned) 
 Ya, yo
