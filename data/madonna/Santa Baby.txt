Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me 
 Been an awful good girl 
 Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight 
 Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue 
 I'll wait up for you dear 
 Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight 
 Come and trim my Christmas tree 
 With some decorations bought at Tiffany's 
 I really do believe in you 
 Let's see if you believe in me 
 Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring 
 I don't mean a phone 
 Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight 
 Oh santa, shimmy down the chimney tonight 
 Ooh santa baby 
 Hurry down the chimney tonight
