I can practice restraint if that's what you want 
 Let me zip up my boots we can go for a walk 
 If I ring you in you can follow my lead 
 We can ride so fast just remember to breathe 
 If you start to get up then I'll tighten my grip 
 If you try to talk back I'll be usin' my whip 
 Might get hard to hear you with my bit (?) in your mouth 
 If it starts to hurt then you'll have to scream out 
 There's no use goin' back 'cause the damage is done 
 Throw away all the rules, 'cause there's gonna be none 
 Go on and let yourself go 'cause there's no time to think 
 And now I'm in control of your animal instinct 
 If you want, I'll treat you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll feed you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll treat you like an animal 
 If you misbehave I can make you submit 
 If you start to act out I can force you to grip 
 If you want me to beg you I can bring you the heel (?) 
 Won't be hard to tame you when it's me that you feel (whoa) 
 There's no use goin' back 'cause the damage is done 
 Throw away all the rules, 'cause there's gonna be none 
 Go on and let yourself go 'cause there's no time to think 
 And now I'm in control of your animal instinct 
 There's no use goin' back 'cause the damage is done 
 Throw away all the rules, 'cause there's gonna be none 
 Go on and let yourself go 'cause there's no time to think 
 And now I'm in control of your animal instinct 
 If you want, I'll treat you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll feed you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll treat you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll treat you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll feed you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal 
 If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
