Am I just dreaming or did you walk through my door? 
 Do you still feel the same way that you did before? 
 Did you come to bring me sorrow like all those wasted days? 
 Let's not think about tomorrow, you can stay 
 Am I just dreaming or did you say you have to go? 
 If you can't stay forever, I don't wanna know 
 There's no need to talk about it, the way things used to be 
 I'm not living here without you 
 Won't you stay? Stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, darlin' 
 Won't you stay? Stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin' 
 No, no, no, can't let go 
 No, no, no, can't let go 
 No, no, no, can't let go 
 Am I just dreaming? 
 Am I just dreaming or did you walk through my door? 
 Do you still feel the same way that you did before? 
 Did you come to bring me sorrow like all those wasted days? 
 Let's not think about tomorrow, you can stay 
 You could stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, darlin' 
 Won't you stay? Stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay darlin' 
 You could stay, stay darlin' 
 You could stay, stay darlin' 
 Won't you stay? Stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin' 
 You could stay, stay, stay, darlin'
