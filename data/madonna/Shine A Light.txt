Hear me, I'm knocking at your door 
 Could it mean I'm coming back for more 
 Could it be I could not stay away 
 Now all I wanna do is say 
 I got to tell you how I feel 
 It's getting oh so dark out here 
 The moonlight is shining on my skin 
 Now open up and let me in 
 Shine a light in your window 
 Ooh, I'm here in the shadow 
 I saw your face in the doorway 
 Ooh, turned around and it slipped away 
 My body's shaking with the cold 
 I'm feeling tired, feeling old 
 And I see your fire burning bright 
 Now please wake up for me tonight 
 Shine a light in your window 
 Ooh, I'm here in the shadow 
 I saw your face in the doorway 
 Ooh, turned around and it slipped away 
 Hear me, I'm knocking at your door 
 And you're in the doorway no more 
 I'll stay right here at your door 
 No way I'm going no more
