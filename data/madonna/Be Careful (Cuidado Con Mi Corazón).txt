Be careful with my heart 
 You could break it 
 Don't take my love for granted 
 Things could change 
 Sometimes I go insane 
 I played the fool and you'll agree 
 I'll never be the same 
 Without you here with me 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Me siento algo desnuda 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Mi corazón 
 Be careful with my heart 
 You could break it 
 Don't take my love for granted 
 Things could change 
 Sometimes I go insane 
 I played the fool and you'll agree 
 I'll never be the same 
 Without you here with me 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Cariño no me lastimes 
 Cuidado (please careful) es mi corazón 
 Mi corazón 
 If I could reach out to you 
 Nothing will stop me 
 Take your head in my hands 
 Tell me what would you do 
 Kiss your eyes, sing you to sleep 
 Your voice sounds like a lullaby 
 Here's my heart, this time to keep 
 Here's my heart to keep 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Me siento algo desnuda 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Mi corazón 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Me siento algo desnuda 
 Cuidado (please careful) con mi corazón 
 Mi corazón
