Confusion 
 Confusion... 
 Down, down, down in your heart 
 Find, find, find the secret 
 Turn, turn, turn your head around 
 Baby we can do it 
 We can do it all right 
 Do you believe in love at first sight? 
 It's an illusion, I don't care 
 Do you believe I can make you feel better 
 Too much confusion, come on over here 
 Can we get together? 
 I really, I really wanna be with you 
 Come on, check it out with me 
 I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too 
 I search, I search, I search my whole life 
 To find, find, find the secret 
 All I did was open up my eyes 
 Baby we can do it 
 We can do it alright 
 Do you believe that we can change the future? 
 Do you believe I can make you feel better? 
 Can we get together? 
 I really, I really wanna be with you 
 Come on, check it out with me 
 I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too 
 Can we get together? 
 I really, I really wanna be with you 
 Come on, check it out with me 
 I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too 
 Get together 
 Get together 
 Get together 
 Get together... 
 It's all illusion 
 There's too much confusion 
 I'll make you feel better 
 If it's bitter at the start 
 Then it's sweeter in the end 
 Do you believe in love at first sight? 
 It's an illusion, I don't care 
 Do you believe I can make you feel better 
 Too much confusion, come on over here 
 Come on over here 
 Come on over here 
 Come on over here 
 Come on over here... 
 Can we get together? 
 I really, I really wanna be with you 
 Come on, check it out with me 
 I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too 
 Get together 
 Get together 
 Get together 
 Get together...
