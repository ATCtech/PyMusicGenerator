Je suis desolée 
 Lo siento 
 Sono spiacente 
 Perdóname 
 I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know 
 Please don't say you're sorry 
 I've heard it all before 
 And I can take care of myself 
 I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know 
 Please don't say forgive me 
 I've seen it all before 
 And I can't take it anymore 
 Je suis desolée 
 Lo siento 
 Sono spiacente 
 Perdóname 
 I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know 
 Please don't say you're sorry 
 I've heard it all before 
 And I can take care of myself 
 I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know 
 Please don't say forgive me 
 I've seen it all before 
 And I can't take it anymore 
 (I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know) 
 (I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know) 
 Je suis desolée 
 Lo siento 
 Sono spiacente 
 Perdóname 
 I've heard it all before 
 I've heard it all before... 
 Please don't say you're sorry 
 Sorry 
 Sorry... 
 (I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know) 
 (I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know) 
 Sorry 
 Sorry...
