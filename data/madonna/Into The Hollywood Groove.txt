(Feat. Missy Elliott) 
 Madonna: 
 Everybody comes to Hollywood 
 They wanna make it in the neighbourhood 
 They like the smell of it in Hollywood 
 H ow could it hurt you when it looks so good 
 Missy: 
 Ooh who that be? 
 Misdemeanor on the MIC 
 I got the fresh kicks, thick hips, best believe me 
 And Madonna 'bout to hit 'em like a tag team 
 You gonna love us in our Gap jeans 
 We walk by 
 People ask 
 "Where you get them jeans?" 
 On fire call emergency 
 G A capital P 
 You know how we 
 And let me go and do my thing 
 I'll bring ya hard on the track 
 If ya know what I mean 
 Hollywood and New York, Madonna is the queen 
 And Misdemeanor say 
 "Gap is the best" 
 Madonna: 
 Get into the groove 
 Let me show you some move 
 Best to take it from me 
 Yeah 
 Get up on your feet 
 Let me step to the beat 
 Show you how it should be 
 Get into the groove 
 Let me show you some move 
 Best to take it from me 
 Get into the groove
