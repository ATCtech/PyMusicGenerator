Won't you come inside, and lay down next to my fire 
 Can you feel my heartbeat, let me show you my desire 
 First you have to tell me please, uh huh 
 Gonna bring you to your knees, uh huh 
 Gonna make you scream for more 
 Come inside and lock the door 
 And let down, let down 
 Let down your guard 
 Ah, ah oww, come inside 
 Ah, ah oww, baby it's all right (it's all right) 
 Ah, ah oww, come inside 
 Ah, ah oww, baby it's all right (it's all right) 
 This is not a one-night stand 
 I care for you, please understand 
 Baby won't you come inside 
 I'll take you for a little ride 
 I wanna touch you there, uh huh 
 Run my fingers through your hair, uh huh 
 Gonna take you for a ride 
 But you have to come inside 
 And let down, let down 
 Let down your guard 
 Ah, ah oww 
 Ah, ah oww (it's all right) 
 Ah, ah oww 
 Ah, ah oww (it's all right, it's all right, it's all right) 
 Ah, ah oow, 'cause I wanna touch you there 
 Ah, ah oww, run my fingers through your hair 
 Ah, ah oww, gonna take you for a ride 
 But you have to come inside 
 And let down 
 Let down your guard 
 Ah (it's all right), ah oww, first you have to tell me please, uh huh 
 Gonna bring you to your knees, (it's all right), uh huh 
 Gonna make you scream for more 
 Come inside and lock the door 
 And let down 
 Let down your guard (it's all right) 
 (Chorus, repeat and fade)
