Do you remember summer 09? 
 Want to go back there every night 
 Just cant lie it was the best time of my life 
 Lying on the beach as the sun blew out 
 Playing this guitar by the fire too loud 
 Oh my my they can never shut us down 
 I used to think that I was better alone 
 Why did I ever want to let you go? 
 Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea 
 The words you whispered I will always believe 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal 
 Show me you care 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 Yeah we were together summer 09 
 Want to roll back like pressing rewind 
 You were mine and we never said goodbye 
 I used to think that I was better alone Better alone 
 Why did I ever want to let you go? Let you go 
 Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea Stared at the sea 
 The words you whispered I will always believe 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal 
 Show me you care 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 ROCK me again 
 ROCK me again 
 ROCK me again yeah 
 I want you to 
 ROCK me again 
 ROCK me again 
 ROCK me again yeah 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal 
 Show me you care 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah 
 I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal 
 Show me you care 
 I want you to rock me rock me rock me yeah
