All along had to talk about it   Like a twoedged sword he touched you and it stabs me   All along I knew you were a phony girl   Sit behind the mask and you control your world   I sit around and I watch your face   I try to find the truth but thats your hiding place   You say you love me that its hard to see   Cause when hes in your arms   Youre throwing rocks at me   Who do you love?   Is it me? Well?   I dont know   Who do you love?   You know me   There is nothing in your eyes   Thats the way you cry girl   All is grand all is bright   Youre just studying my mind   I walk around Im suffering in my doom   When I come to you youre sitting in your room   You sit around the strangest place   So take off the mask so I can see your face   Who do love?   Is it me is it him? Well?   I dont know   Who do you love?   I know you   Heaven must be wearing   Your smile is scary you got me scared girl   Insincere empty tears   Wheres your soul?   Where did it go?   Heaven must be wearing   Your smile is scary   Insincere empty tears   Wheres your soul?   Where did it go?   I walk around Im suffering in my doom   When I come to you youre sitting in your room   You sit around in the strangest place   So take off the mask so I can see your face   Who do you love?   Is it me? Well?   I dont know   Who do you love?   I know you   Who do you love?   Is it me? Well?   I dont know   Who do you love?   I dont know   I dont wanna talk about it lets talk about it
