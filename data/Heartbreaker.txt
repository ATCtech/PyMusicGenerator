Deceitful eyes shes got those come get me thighs 
 She only knows how low that she can go 
 She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
 Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
 She blew a kiss I swear that it was meant 
 Only for me then spoke with her body 
 Her only goal is just to take control 
 And I cant believe that I cant tell her no 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her shes a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 Shes a heartbreaker 
 She plays a game with such an innocent face 
 I didnt know heartbreaking was her case 
 Her actions confess and put me through the test 
 I was surprised that I was caught inside 
 Now shes thinking that I will never know 
 And shell keep playing until I let her go 
 But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
 Im onto her game and shell get played the same 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her shes a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 Shes a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her shes a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 Shes a heartbreaker 
 I never thought that I would stop dreamin about you 
 Stop being without you 
 But everyone told me so to stop caring about you 
 And start being without you 
 But Ill find a way to go and start doin without you 
 And stop talkin about you 
 And what will she say? 
 She will say I was the man that got away 
 You playing huh I thought it was love with this game huh 
 When youre dealing with the emotions of pain huh 
 Take a closer look when youre dealing with a stranger 
 I cant change her no 
 Heart murder in place then youll see 
 A one hill from pepsi they see 
 One hard player shes a star player 
 I need this crap huh 
 I didnt see the heartbreaker so come on 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her shes a heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I cant take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 Shes a heartbreaker
