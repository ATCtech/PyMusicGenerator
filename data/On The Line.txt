No sense pretending its over   Hard times just dont go away   You gotta take that chip off your shoulder   Its time you open up   Have some faith   Nothing good ever comes easy   All good things come in due time   Yes it does   You gotta have something to believe in   Im telling you to open your mind   Gotta put your heart on the line   If you wanna make it right   Youve got to reach out and try   Gotta put your heart on the line   If you wanna make it right   Gotta put it all on the line   You see yourself in the mirror   And you dont like what you see   And things arent getting much clearer   Dont you think its time you go for a change   Dont waste your time on the past no no   Its time you look to the future   Its all right there if you ask   This time if you try much harder   Youll be the best that you can be   If you wanna make it right   If you wanna do it now   You gotta learn to try   You can make it right somehow   Let love come free   And thats just so easy now   You gotta go for what you want   You gotta do what you got to do   Repeat and fade out
