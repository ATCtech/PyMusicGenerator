Somebody shakes when the wind blows 
 Somebodys missing a friend Hold on 
 Somebodys lacking a hero 
 And they have not a clue when its all gonna end again 
 Stories buried and untold 
 Someone is hiding the truth Hold on 
 When will this mystery unfold 
 And will the sun ever shine 
 In the blind mans eyes when he cries 
 You can change the world I cant do it by myself 
 You can touch the sky Its gonna take somebodys help 
 Youre the chosen one Im gonna need some kind of sign 
 If we all cry at the same time tonight 
 If people laugh when theyre feeling sad 
 Someone is taking a life Hold on 
 Respect to believe in your dreams 
 So tell me where were you 
 When your children cried last night 
 Faces filled with madness 
 Miracles unheard of Hold on 
 Faith is found in the winds 
 All we have to do is to reach for the truth the truth 
 You can change the world I cant do it by myself 
 You can touch the sky Its gonna take somebodys help 
 Youre the chosen one Im gonna need some kind of sign 
 If we all cry at the same time tonight 
 And when that flag glows therell be no more wars 
 And when all cause I will answer all your prayers Prayers 
 Show the world 
 You can change the world I cant do it by myself 
 You can touch the sky Its gonna take somebodys help 
 Youre the chosen one Im gonna need some kind of sign 
 If we all cry at the same time tonight
