I thought she had to have it 
 Since the first time she came 
 Who knows the situation 
 Mysteries do remain 
 And now I wonder why 
 I breakdown when I cry 
 Is it something I said 
 Or is it just a lie 
 Is it just a lie 
 I try so hard to love you 
 Some things take 
 Time and shame 
 I think the whole world 
 Of you 
 Your thoughts of me remain 
 Ill play the fool for you 
 Ill change the rules for you 
 Just say it and Ill do 
 Just make this thing come true 
 Make a dream come true 
 If I let her get away 
 Though Im begging 
 On my knees 
 Ill be crying everyday 
 Knowing the girl 
 That got away 
 I cant let 
 I cant let her get away 
 I cant let 
 I cant let her get away 
 I cant let 
 I cant let her get away 
 I cant let 
 I cant let her get away 
 I tried to mastermind it 
 By saying let it be 
 But every time I did it 
 The hurt came back at me 
 I told you that I need you 
 A thousand times and why 
 I played the fool for you 
 And still you said goodbye 
 Still you said goodbye 
 If I let her get away 
 Then the world will 
 Have to see 
 A fool who lives alone 
 And the fool who 
 Set you free 
 I cant let 
 I Cant Let Her Get Away 
 I cant let 
 I Cant Let Her Get Away
