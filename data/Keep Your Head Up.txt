Shes looking for a job and 
 To find a place to stay 
 Shes looking for the hope 
 In the empty promises 
 Shes working two jobs keeping alive 
 She works in a restaurant night and day 
 She waits her life away 
 She wipes the tears away 
 She cries inside 
 Every time she feels this way 
 And shes dying inside 
 Every time her baby cries 
 Keeping your head up to the sky 
 Keeping your mind up stay alive 
 Gimme your wings so we can fly 
 Keep your head up tonight 
 Keep your head up the sky 
 We can just rise up tell me now 
 Give me your wings so we can fly 
 Were killing up the life in the birds 
 And the trees 
 And were sucking up the air 
 In the earth from under me 
 Its never too late  just lean on me 
 I cant even breathe 
 I cant even see 
 Keep your head up 
 Dont give up today 
 How long can we wait 
 I wish the love would come today 
 Keeping your head up to the sky 
 Keeping your mind up stay alive 
 Gimme your wings so we can fly 
 Keep your head up tonight 
 Keep your head up the sky 
 We can just rise up tell me now 
 Give me your wings so we can fly 
 Everybody say that time is borrowed 
 And hanging down our head 
 Just aint no good 
 And if you dare to rise above tomorrow 
 Just give yourself a chance 
 Fight the circumstance 
 Rise and do it again 
 Keeping your head up to the sky 
 Keeping your mind up stay alive 
 Gimme your wings so we can fly 
 Keeping your head up to the sky 
 Keeping your mind up stay alive 
 Gimme your wings so we can fly 
 Gimme me your wings so we can fly 
 I need your love 
 I need you now 
 I need your light right here today 
 I need you now
