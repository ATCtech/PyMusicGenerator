I gave her money 
 I gave her time 
 I gave her everything 
 Inside one heart could find 
 I gave her passion 
 My very soul 
 I gave her promises 
 And secrets so untold 
 And she promised me forever 
 And a day wed live as one 
 We made our vows 
 Wed live a life anew 
 And she promised me in secret 
 That shed love me for all time 
 Its a promise so untrue 
 Tell me what will I do? 
 And it doesnt seem to matter 
 And it doesnt seem right 
 Cause the will has brought 
 No fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Dont you judge of my composure 
 Cause Im lying to myself 
 And the reason why she left me 
 Did she find in someone else? 
 Who is it? 
 It is a friend of mine 
 Who is it? 
 Is it my brother 
 Who is it? 
 Somebody hurt my soul now 
 Who is it? 
 I cant take this stuff no more 
 I am the damned 
 I am the dead 
 I am the agony inside 
 The dying head 
 This is injustice 
 Woe unto thee 
 I pray this punishment 
 Would have mercy on me 
 And she promised me forever 
 That wed live our life as one 
 We made our vows 
 Wed live a love so true 
 It seems that she has left me 
 For such reasons unexplained 
 I need to find the truth 
 But see what will I do 
 And it doesnt seem to matter 
 And it doesnt seem right 
 Cause the will has brought 
 No fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Dont you judge of my composure 
 Cause Im bothered everyday 
 And she didnt leave a letter 
 She just up and ran away 
 Who is it? 
 It is a friend of mine 
 Who is it? 
 Is it my brother? 
 Who is it? 
 Somebody hurt my soul now 
 Who is it? 
 I cant take it cause Im lonely 
 Who is it? 
 It is friend of mine 
 Who is it? 
 To me Im bothered 
 Who is it? 
 Somebody hurt my soul now 
 Who is it? 
 I cant take it cause Im lonely 
 And it doesnt seem to matter 
 And it doesnt seen right 
 Cause the will has brought 
 No fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Dont you judge of my composure 
 Cause Im lying to myself 
 And the reason why she left me 
 Did she find someone else? 
 And it doesnt seem to matter 
 And it doesnt seem right 
 Cause the will has brought 
 No fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Dont you judge of my composure 
 Cause Im bothered everyday 
 And she didnt leave a letter 
 She just up and ran away 
 And it doesnt seem to matter 
 And it doesnt seem right 
 Cause the will has brought
