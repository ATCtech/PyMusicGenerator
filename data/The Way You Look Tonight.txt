There was a time 
 I was everything and nothing all in one 
 When you found me 
 I was feeling like a cloud across the sun 
 I need to tell ya 
 How you light up every second of the day 
 But in the moonlight 
 You just shine like a beacon on the bay 
 And I cant explain 
 But theres something about the way you look tonight 
 Takes my breath away 
 Its that feeling I get about you deep inside 
 And I cant describe 
 But theres something about the way you look tonight 
 Takes my breath away 
 The way you look tonight 
 With a smile 
 You pull the deepest secrets from my heart 
 In all honesty 
 Im speechless and I dont know where to start 
 And I cant explain 
 But theres something about the way you look tonight 
 Oh takes my breath away 
 Its that feeling I get about you deep inside 
 And I cant describe 
 But theres something about the way you look tonight 
 Takes my breath away 
 The way you look tonight
