 For losing you 
 Girl I cant get ready 
 No no no

 Oh cant get ready 
 No girl for losing you 
 Losing you 
 Thought I had your love 
 In the palm of my hands 
 But I let it slip away from me girl 
 And now youre happy with another guy 
 Someone who doesnt make you cry 
 He doesnt make you cry 
 And now its got me shedding tears 
 Oh girl how I wish you were here 
 Cause I cant get ready 
 No for losing you

 Oh girl for losing you

 Oh girl for losing you 
 Losing you 
 Girl I took your love for granted 
 I know I know I treated you so unkind 
 And now the shoe is on the other foot 
 And you dont even took a second look 
 You told me there would come a time 
 Oh girl

 Cause I cant get ready 
 No no no no no for losing you 
 Oh cant get ready
