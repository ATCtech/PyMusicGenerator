Im like a crow on a wire   Youre the shining distraction that makes me fly home   Im like a boat on the water   Youre the rays on the waves that calm my mind   Oh every time   And I know in my heart youre not a constant star   And yeah I let you use me from the day that we first met   But Im not done yet falling for ya   Fools gold   And I knew that you turn it on for everyone you met   But I dont regret falling for ya   Fools gold   Im the first to admit that Im reckless   I get lost in your beauty and I cant see two feet in front of me   And I know in my heart youre just a moving part   And yeah I let you use me from the day that we first met   But Im not done yet falling for ya   Fools gold   And I knew that you turn it on for everyone you met   But I dont regret falling for ya   Fools gold   Yeah I know your loves not real   Thats not the way it feels   Thats not the way you feel   And yes I let you use me from the day that we first met   But Im not done yet falling for ya   Fools gold   And I knew that you turn it on for everyone you met   But I dont regret falling for ya   Fools gold   Oh oh oh oh oh oh
