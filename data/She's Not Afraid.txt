Yeah 
 1 2 3 4 
 She sneaks out in the middle of the night yeah 
 Tight dress with the top cut low 
 Shes addicted to the feeling of letting go 
 Oh woah let it go 
 She walks in and the room just lights up 
 But she dont want anyone to know 
 That Im the only one that gets to take her home 
 Oh take her home 
 But every time I tell her that I want more 
 She closes the door 
 Shes not afraid of all the attention 
 Shes not afraid of running wild 
 How come shes so afraid of falling in love? 
 Shes not afraid of scary movies 
 She likes the way we kiss in the dark 
 But shes so afraid of fafafalling in love love 
 Maybe shes just trying to test me 
 Want to see how hard Im gonna work 
 Want to see if I can really tell 
 How much shes worth Whatcha worth 
 Or maybe all of her friends have told her 
 Dont get closer hell just break your heart 
 But either way shes teasing me 
 And its just so hard So hard 
 Cause every time I tell her how I feel 
 She says its not real 
 Shes not afraid of all the attention 
 Shes not afraid of running wild 
 How come shes so afraid of falling in love? 
 Shes not afraid of scary movies 
 She likes the way we kiss in the dark 
 But shes so afraid of fafafalling in love love 
 What about all the the things we say 
 Talking on the phone so late 
 I cant let her get away from me oh 
 When I say that I cant do it no more 
 Shes back at my door shes not afraid 
 Shes not afraid of all the attention 
 Shes not afraid of running wild Running wild 
 How come shes so afraid of falling in love? Falling in love 
 Shes not afraid of scary movies Shes not afraid 
 She likes the way we kiss in the dark Kiss in the dark 
 But shes so afraid of fafafalling in love love 
 Shes not afraid 
 Shes not afraid
