Ill make things right
Ill break your fall
Unshatter glass
And fix the wall you gave to me
Wish me away and Ill be gone
I didnt mean to block your sun with
My shadow


Im going where Im wanted in my dreams
Im going where Im wanted in my dreams
Sleep on the floor
Uncovered mattresses and cigarette burns
In the blanket that I made for you
And I wasnt sure just what to say
Guess I got scared and ran away hey


Perfect
Im sure Ive felt this way before
Dear god it hurts so bad sometimes
This time I feel its something more
How could I ever be so blind? Hey


Maybe youll be there
