I watched you on the floor 
 Cheek to cheek 
 Shes getting to you 
 You didnt see 
 Her eyes on me no 
 She looked right through you 
 Before you make 
 A big mistake remember 
 That looks can fool you baby 
 Theres somethin I would sure appreciate 
 If you can keep a secret 
 Baby loves me but she never shows she cares 
 No you wont see her kiss and hug me 
 Baby loves me though she acts like Im not there 
 That doesnt mean she doesnt love me ooh 
 If they ask her tell em that were just good friends 
 Just good friends 
 Doot do doo doo 
 Just good friends 
 You better take advice 
 Never trust first impressions 
 I tried to hide this affair 
 From their suspicions 
 So even if shes askin you to stay 
 You better know where you stand 
 Baby loves me though she never shows she cares 
 No you wont see her kiss and hug me 
 My baby loves me though she acts like Im not there 
 That doesnt mean she doesnt love me ooh 
 Now if they ask you jus tell em that were just good friends 
 Yes just good friends 
 Root do do do do do doo doo 
 Just good friends 
 Listen up 
 Weve got a problem here I can see the signs 
 I guess the lady is still makin up her mind 
 Say were just good friends 
 Baby loves me though she never shows she cares 
 No you wont see her kiss and hug me 
 My baby loves me though she acts like Im not there 
 You doggone lover 
 Dont you wanna know? 
 My Baby loves me though she never shows she cares 
 She doesnt kiss and hug me 
 My baby loves me she love me she love me 
 Incomprehensible 
 Just good friends 
 Baby loves me she love me she love me she loves me 
 Incomprehensible
