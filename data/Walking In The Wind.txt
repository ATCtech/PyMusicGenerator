A week ago you said to me 
 Do you believe Ill never be too far 
 If youre lost just look for me 
 Youll find me in the region of the summer stars 
 Fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye 
 Means weve already won 
 A necessity for apologies between you and me 
 Baby there is none 
 We had some good times didnt we? 
 We had some good tricks up our sleeve 
 Goodbyes are bittersweet 
 But its not the end 
 Ill see your face again 
 You will find me 
 And you will find me 
 In places that weve never been 
 For reasons we dont understand 
 Walking in the wind 
 Walking in the wind 
 Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend 
 But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast 
 I realized you were missing 
 We had some good times didnt we? 
 We wore our hearts out on our sleeve 
 Goodbyes are bittersweet 
 But its not the end 
 Ill see your face again 
 You will find me 
 And you will find me 
 In places that weve never been 
 For reasons we dont understand 
 Walking in the wind 
 Walking in the wind 
 I know Ill be your anchor 
 Just close your eyes and see 
 Ill be by your side 
 Any time youre needing me 
 You will find me 
 And you will find me 
 In places that weve never been 
 For reasons we dont understand 
 Walking in the wind 
 Walking in the wind 
 Walking in the wind
