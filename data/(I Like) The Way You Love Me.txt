Ok this is the tempo and the melody 
 I was alone dark when I met ya 
 Drums 
 I was alone in the dark when I met ya 
 Ooh ooh 
 You took my hand and you told me you loved me 
 Ooh ooh 
 I was alone there was no love in my life 
 I was alone there was no love in my life 
 I was afraid of life and you came in time 
 I was afraid of life and you came in time 
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
 Ooh ooh 
 I like the way how youre holdin me 
 It doesnt matter how youre holdin me 
 I like the way youre lovin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are lovin me 
 I like the way how youre touchin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are touchin me 
 I like the way how youre kissin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are kissin me 
 Youll seeeee 
 It wont be long till we make vows I bet ya 
 Ooh ooh 
 I thank the Heavens above that I met ya 
 Ooh ooh 
 I was alone there was no love in my life 
 I was alone there was no love in my life 
 I was afraid of life and you came in time 
 I was afraid of life and you came in time 
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
 You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
 Ooh 
 I like the way how youre lovin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are holdin me 
 I like the way how youre holdin me 
 It doesnt matter how you re lovin me 
 I like the way how youre touchin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are touchin me 
 I like the way how youre kissin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are kissin me 
 The worlds a better place 
 Cause you came in time 
 You took away the rain and brought the sunshine 
 I was afraid cause I was hurt the last time 
 Ooh Ah

 It doesnt matter how you are holdin me 
 I like the way how youre lovin me 
 It doesnt matter how you are lovin me
