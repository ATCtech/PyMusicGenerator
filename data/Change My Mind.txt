The end of the night 
 We should say goodbye 
 But we carry on 
 While everyones gone 
 Never felt like this before 
 Are we friends or are we more? 
 As Im walking towards the door 
 Im not sure 
 But baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Ill change my mind 
 Cause I dont want to know Im walking away 
 If youll be mine 
 Wont go wont go 
 So baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Stay for the night 
 Ill change my mind 
 Lean in when you laugh 
 We take photographs 
 Theres no music on 
 But we dance alone 
 Never felt like this before 
 Are we friends or are we more? 
 As Im walking towards the door 
 Im not sure 
 But baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Ill change my mind 
 Cause I dont want to know Im walking away 
 If youll be mine 
 Wont go wont go 
 So baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Stay for the night 
 Ill change my mind 
 Ill change my mind 
 Baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Ill change my mind 
 But baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Ill change my mind 
 Cause I dont want to know Im walking away 
 If youll be mine 
 Wont go wont go 
 So baby if you say you want me to stay 
 Stay for the night 
 Ill change my mind
