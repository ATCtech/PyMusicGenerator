Been a lot of places   Ive been all around the world   Seen a lot of faces   Never knowing where I was   On the horizon   Well I know I know I know I know   The sun will be rising back home   Living out of cases   Packing up and taking off   Made a lot of changes   But not forgetting who I was   On the horizon   Oh well I know I know I know I know   The moon will be rising back home   Dont forget where you belong home   Dont forget where you belong home   If you ever feel alone dont   You were never on your own   And the proof is in this song   Ive been away for ages   But I got everything I need   Im flicking through the pages   Ive written in my memory   I feel like Im dreaming   Oh so I know I know I know I know   That Im never leaving   No I wont go   Dont forget where you belong home   Dont forget where you belong home   If you ever feel alone dont   You were never on your own   And the proof is in this song   Lights off when they should be on   Even stars in the skies theyre wrong   Short days when the nights are long   When I think of the things Ive done   Dont matter how far Ive gone   Im always free to run home   Dont forget where you belong home   Dont forget where you belong home Dont forget it   If you ever feel alone dont   You were never on your own   Never never never   Dont forget where you belong home   Dont forget where you belong home Dont forget it   If you ever feel alone dont   You were never on your own You were never   And the proof is in this song   Home dont forget it   Home If you ever feel alone dont   You were never on your own You were never   And the proof is in this song   Never forget it this song   Dont forget it   No Ill never forget it this song   You were never
