Never have I ever been so sure   Oh no now   Never thought Id see you walk in that door   Oh now yeah   I can make you feel like youre a queen   No remedies no compromise   Would you rather be right here with me   I want you right here next to me   Do you really wanna stay?   We can take it slow   Do you wanna walk away   If you let it go   Girl Im writing you this letter just to say goodbye   Ill be standing in the rain in case you change your mind   Do you really wanna stay?   We can take it slow   Do you really wanna go?   If you let it go   So Im writing you this letter just to say goodbye   Ill be standing in the rain in case you change your mind   She never thought shed be here waiting on me   Oh no now   Id never thought Id be here back in my ways   When youre in need   Your fantasy all here with me   Would you rather be right here with me   Girl get into me   Anything oh anything   To chase the rain goodbye   When you left with all your dreams   I couldnt say goodnight   She was contagious she was contagious   She was my baby   To carry on ? I love you   Say goodbye say goodbye   Dont go away   Stay by my side   Stay by my side
