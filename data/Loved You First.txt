Girl that should be me 
 Driving to your house 
 Knocking on your door 
 Kissing you on the mouth 
 Holding on your hand 
 Dancing in the dark 
 Cause I was the only one 
 Who loved you from the start 
 But now when I see you with him 
 It tears my world apart 
 Because Ive been waiting 
 All this time to finally say it 
 But now I see your hearts been taken 
 And nothing could be worse 
 Baby I loved you first 
 Had my chances 
 Could have been where he is standing 
 Thats what hurts the most 
 Girl I came so close 
 But now youll never know 
 Baby I loved you first 
 Girl it should be me 
 Calling on your phone 
 Saying youre the one 
 And that Ill never let you go 
 I never understood 
 What love was really like 
 But I felt it for the first time 
 Looking in your eyes 
 But now when I see you with him 
 My whole world falls apart 
 Because Ive been waiting 
 All this time to finally say it 
 But now I see your hearts been taken 
 And nothing could be worse 
 Baby I loved you first 
 Had my chances 
 Could have been where he is standing 
 Thats what hurts the most 
 Girl I came so close 
 But now youll never know 
 Baby I loved you first 
 The first touch the first kiss 
 The first girl who made me feel like this 
 Heartbreak its killing me 
 I loved you first why cant you see? 
 Ive been waiting 
 All this time to finally say it 
 But now I see your hearts been taken 
 And nothing could be worse 
 Baby I loved you first 
 Had my chances 
 Could have been where he is standing 
 Thats what hurts the most 
 Girl I came so close 
 But now youll never know 
 Baby I loved you first 
 Baby I loved you first 
 Baby I loved you first oh yeah 
 Baby I loved you first
