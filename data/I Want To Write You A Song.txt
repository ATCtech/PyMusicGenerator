I want to write you a song 
 One thats beautiful as you are sweet 
 Just a hint of pain 
 For the feeling that I get when you are gone 
 I want to write you a song 
 I want to lend you my coat 
 One thats as soft as your cheek 
 So when the world is cold 
 Youll have a hiding place you can go 
 I want to lend you my coat 
 Everything I need I get from you 
 Givin back is all I wanna do 
 I want to build you a boat 
 One thats strong as you are free 
 So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink 
 You know it wont 
 I want to build you a boat 
 Everything I need I get from you 
 Givin back is all I wanna do 
 Everything I need I get from you 
 Givin back is all I wanna do 
 I want to write you a song 
 One to make your heart remember me 
 So any time Im gone 
 You can listen to my voice and sing along 
 I want to write you a song 
 I want to write you a song
