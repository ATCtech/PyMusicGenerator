Once in a lifetime   Its just right   We make no mistakes   Not even a landslide or riptide   Could take it all away   Somehow it feels like nothing has changed   Right now my heart is beating the same   Out loud someones calling my name   It sounds like you   When I close my eyes   All the stars align   And you are by my side   You are by my side   Once in a lifetime   Its just right and we are always safe   Not even the bad guys and the dark nights   Could take it all away   Somehow it feels like nothing has changed   Right now my heart is beating the same   Out loud someones calling my name   And it sounds like you   When I close my eyes   All the stars align   And you are by my side   You are by my side   You are by my side   You are by my side   Once in a lifetime   You were mine
