With a childs heart   Go face the worries of the day   With a childs heart   Turn each problem into play   No need to worry no need to fear   Just being alive makes it all so very clear   With a childs heart   Nothing can ever get you down   With a childs heart   Youve got no reason to frown   Love is as welcome   As a sunny sunny day   No grownup thoughts   To lead our hearts astray   Take life easy so easy nice and easy   Like a child so gay and so carefree   The whole world smiles with you   As you go your merry way   Oh with a childs heart   Nothings gonna get me down
