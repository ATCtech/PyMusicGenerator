Said Id never leave her   Cause her hands fit like my tshirt   Tonguetied over three words cursed   Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt   Bodies intertwined with her lips   Now shes feeling so low   Since she went solo   Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo   And its no joke to me   So can we do it all over again   If youre pretending from the start like this   With a tight grip then my kiss   Can mend your broken heart   I might miss everything you said to me   And I could lend you broken parts   That might fit like this   And I will give you all my heart   So we can start it all over again   Can we take the same road   Two days in the same clothes?   And I know just what shell say   If I can make all this pain go   Can we stop this for a minute?   You know I can tell your heart isnt in it or with it   Tell me with your mind body and spirit   I can make your tears fall down   Like the showers that are British   Whether were together or apart   We can both remove the masks   And admit we regret it from the start   If youre pretending from the start like this   With a tight grip then my kiss   Can mend your broken heart   I might miss everything you said to me   And I could lend you broken parts   That might fit like this   And I will give you all my heart   So we can start it all over again   Youll never know how to make it on your own   And youll never show weakness for letting go   I guess its still hard if the seeds sown   But do you really want to be alone?   If youre pretending from the start like this   With a tight grip then my kiss   Can mend your broken heart   I might miss everything you said to me   And I could lend you broken parts   That might fit like this   And I will give you all my heart   So we can start it all over again   If youre pretending from the start like this   With a tight grip then my kiss   Can mend your broken heart   I might miss everything you said to me   And I could lend you broken parts   That might fit like this   And I will give you all my heart   So we can start it all over again
