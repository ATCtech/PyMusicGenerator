Train arrive, sixteen coaches long 
 Train arrive, sixteen coaches long 
 Well, that long, black train 
 Got my baby and gone 
 Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend 
 Train train, comin' 'round the bend 
 Well, it took my baby, but it never will again 
 No, not again 
 Train train, comin' down, down the line 
 Train train, comin' down the line 
 Well, it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine, all mine 
 She's mine, all mine 
 Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend, 'round, 'round the bend 
 Train train, comin' round, 'round the bend, 'round the bend 
 Well, it took my baby, but it never will again 
 No, never will again
