All right girls, I'll show you what to do 
 This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through 
 By the numbers, there ain't much time 
 We're gonna start an assembly line 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 You get the sandpaper, you get the pails 
 You get the hammer baby, you get the nails 
 You get the paint, you get the brush 
 'Cause we're gonna give it the special touch 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 We got a magic potion that will help us win 
 I don't know how to spell it but dip right in 
 Blako-oxy-tonic phosphate, it's the latest scoop 
 But that's all right girls, you can call it "Goop" 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Work the sandpaper, hammer that nail 
 Tote that paintbrush and lift that pail 
 Get a rhythm going, nice and easy 
 Come on and use a little elbow greasy 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Okay girls, we're all through 
 I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do 
 We'll fall right down and have some fun 
 And I'm gonna kiss you all one by one 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
