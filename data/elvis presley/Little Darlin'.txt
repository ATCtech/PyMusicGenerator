Little darlin', little darlin' 
 Oh where, are you, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Walla walla chipa mocka mogga 
 Oh my lover, oh just for you, only you 
 My darling, I need you 
 Darling I need you to call my own 
 To hold your life, your little foot, your hand 
 I knew someone would understand that 
 Hold my hand 
 My dear, I would run 
 To find without you 
 Oh, ooh ooh ooh 
 That my love was just for you, 'n only you'
