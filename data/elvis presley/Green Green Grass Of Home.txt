The old home town looks the same 
 As I step down from the train 
 And there to meet me is my mama and my papa 
 Down the road I look and there runs Mary 
 Hair of gold and lips like cherries 
 It's good to touch the green, green grass of home 
 Yes, and they'll all come to meet me 
 Arms reachin', smiling sweetly 
 Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home 
 The old house is still standing 
 Though the paint is cracked and dry 
 And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on 
 Yeah, down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary 
 Hair of gold and lips like cherries 
 It's good to touch the green, green grass of home 
 Yes, and they'll all come to meet me 
 Arms reachin', smiling sweetly 
 Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home 
 spoken: 
 Then I awake and look around me 
 Four gray walls surround me 
 And I realize I was only dreamin' 
 There's a guard and there's a sad old padre 
 Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak 
 Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home 
 sung: 
 Yes, and they'll all come to see me 
 In the shade of an old oak tree 
 As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home
