You're the one who beckoned the wind 
 And fanned the flame when our love began 
 So don't pretend you don't know me 
 Our names are carved on you, singing tree 
 Oh, singing tree (singing tree) 
 Sing to me (sing to me) 
 Call your friend (call your friend) 
 The roving wind (the roving wind) 
 Maybe he can find my love 
 And bring her back, singing tree 
 Your leaves have turned from green to blue 
 Sometimes I think you loved her too 
 But since she left and our love died 
 You stand petrified, singing tree 
 Oh, sing to me (sing to me) 
 Singing tree (singing tree) 
 Call your friend (call your friend) 
 The roving wind (the roving wind) 
 Maybe he can find my love 
 And bring her back, singing tree 
 Oh, sing to me (sing to me) 
 Singing tree (singing tree) 
 Call your friend (call your friend) 
 The roving wind (the roving wind) 
 Maybe he can find my love 
 And bring her back, singing tree
