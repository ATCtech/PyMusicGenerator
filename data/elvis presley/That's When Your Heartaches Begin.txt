If you find your sweetheart 
 In the arms of a friend 
 That's when your heartaches begin 
 When dreams of a lifetime 
 Must come to an end 
 That's when your heartaches begin 
 Love is a thing 
 You never can share 
 When you bring a friend 
 Into your love affair 
 That's the end of your sweetheart 
 That's the end of your friend 
 That's when your heartaches begin 
 If you find your sweetheart 
 In the arms of your best friend 
 Brother, that's, that's when your heartaches begin 
 And you know, when all of your dreams 
 When all of your dreams of a lifetime, must, must all come to an end 
 Yeah that's, yeah that's when your heartaches begin 
 For you see love is a thing 
 That, that you never can share 
 And you know, when you bring a friend 
 Ah, into your love affair 
 That's the end of your sweetheart 
 That's the end of your friend 
 That's the when your heartaches begin
