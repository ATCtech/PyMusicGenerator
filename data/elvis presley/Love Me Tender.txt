(Barbra Streisand) 
 Wasn't it just yesterday 
 When you held me near? 
 Whispering the sweetest words 
 That I longed to hear? 
 (Elvis Presley) 
 Love me tender 
 Love me sweet 
 Never let me go 
 (Barbra Streisand) 
 You have made my life complete 
 And I love you so 
 (Elvis Presley) 
 Love me tender 
 Love me true 
 All my dreams fulfilled 
 (Barbra Streisand) 
 For my darling I love you 
 And I always will 
 (Barbra Streisand and Elvis Presley) 
 Love me tender 
 Love me long 
 Take me to your heart 
 For it's there that I belong 
 And we'll never part 
 (Elvis Presley) 
 Love me tender 
 Love me true 
 All my dreams fulfilled 
 (Barbra Streisand) 
 For my darling I love you 
 And I always will 
 (Barbra Streisand and Elvis Presley) 
 Love me tender 
 Love me true 
 Tell me you are mine 
 I'll be yours through all the years 
 Till the end of time 
 (Elvis Presley) 
 Love me tender 
 Love me true 
 All my dreams fulfilled 
 (Barbra Streisand) 
 For my darling I love you 
 And I always will 
 And I always will
