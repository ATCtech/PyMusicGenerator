Like a ship without a compass 
 On a cold lonely sea 
 No beacon light of love to guide me through 
 I lost the only treasure 
 That means anything to me 
 What now, what next, where to? 
 I thought I had a love that would be mine eternally 
 I felt so sure you'd be forever true 
 Now everything I counted on has crumbled under you 
 What now, what next, where to? 
 You were part of every dream I dreamed, 
 Of everything I planned 
 How could I know our castles 
 Were built upon the sand 
 Won't heaven send an angel please, 
 To tell me what to do 
 What now, what next, where to? 
 What now, what next, where to?
