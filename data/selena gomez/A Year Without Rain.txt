Ooh... 
 Ooh... 
 Can you feel me 
 When I think about you? 
 With every breath I take, 
 Every minute, 
 No matter what I do 
 My world is an empty place. 
 Like I've been wandering the desert 
 For a thousand days (ooh). 
 Don't know if it's a mirage 
 But I always see your face, baby! 
 I'm missing you so much, 
 Can't help it, I'm in love, 
 A day without you is like a year without rain. 
 I need you by my side, 
 Don't know how I'll survive, 
 A day without you is like a year without rain (oh). 
 Ooh... 
 The stars are burning, 
 I hear your voice in my mind (It's in my mind), 
 Can't you hear me calling? 
 My heart is yearnin', 
 Like the ocean is running dry. 
 Catch me, I'm falling. 
 It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet, (Won't you save me?) 
 There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, 
 Ooh, baby. 
 I'm missing you so much, 
 Can't help it, I'm in love, 
 A day without you is like a year without rain. 
 I need you by my side, 
 Don't know how I'll survive, 
 A day without you is like a year without rain (oh). 
 Ooh... 
 So let this drought come to an end 
 And make this desert flower again. 
 I'm so glad you found me, 
 Stick around me, 
 Baby, baby, baby (ooh). 
 It's a world of wonder with you in my life, 
 So hurry baby, don't waste no more time. 
 I need you here, 
 I can't explain, 
 But A day without you, is like a year without rain (oh). 
 I'm missing you so much (so much...), 
 Can't help it, I'm in love, 
 A day without you is like a year without rain. 
 I need you by my side (my side...), 
 Don't know how I'll survive, 
 A day without you is like a year without rain (oh). 
 Ooh... 
 Ooh... 
 Ooh... 
 Whoa...
