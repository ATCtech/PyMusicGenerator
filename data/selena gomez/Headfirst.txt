We talk on the phone every night 
 I'm losing sleep 
 And when we hang up, you're in my dreams 
 You're everywhere I go, or so it seems 
 And when I get around you 
 I say stupid things 
 And things I don't mean 
 I'm falling head first over you 
 (Over you) 
 I'm falling head first over you 
 You're floating me up now 
 Just like a balloon 
 I'm slipping and falling head first 
 I'm falling for you 
 I'm falling for you 
 Boy, give me a sign 
 Show me the light 
 'Cause I'm hanging on to every word you say 
 My cover's blown 
 Is that okay? 
 'Cause I'm getting feelings 
 That I just can't shake 
 Do you feel the same way? 
 I'm falling head first over you (over you) 
 I'm falling head first over you 
 You're floating me up now, just like a balloon. 
 I'm slipping and I'm falling head first (head first) 
 I'm falling for you. 
 I'm falling for you, with the things that you do. 
 I'm falling for you (I'm falling, I'm falling) 
 I'm falling for you, with the things that you do. 
 (Head first, head first, head first, head first) 
 With the things that you do! 
 I'm falling head first over you 
 (Over you) 
 I'm falling head first over you 
 You're floating me up now 
 Just like a balloon 
 I'm slipping and falling head first 
 I'm falling head first over you 
 (Over you) 
 I'm falling head first over you (you got me) 
 You're floating me up now 
 Just like a balloon 
 I'm slipping and falling, baby 
 I'm falling for you 
 I'm falling for you 
 I'm falling for you
