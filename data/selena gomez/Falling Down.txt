Oh-oh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh 
 You walk and talk like you're some new sensation, 
 You move in circles, you don't need an invitation. 
 You spend your money, you can get no satisfaction, 
 You play it right so you can get the right reaction. 
 It won't be long, my darling. 
 Pick up the phone, nobody's on it. 
 Where are your friends now, baby? 
 All of the ones supposed to be there for. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, the world starts spinning round. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, now it's not all about. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, you know I'll be around. 
 You're falling down, falling down. 
 (Falling down, you're falling down, falling down) 
 Without a place you're lookin' in the mirror? 
 The truth is blurry but the lies are gettin' clearer. 
 Your eyes are fixed, your smile is so elastic. 
 You give me roses but they're all just made of plastic. 
 It won't be long, my darling. 
 Pick up the phone, nobody's on it. 
 Where are your friends now, baby? 
 All of the ones supposed to be there for. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, the world starts spinning round. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, now it's not all about. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, you know I'll be around. 
 You're falling down, falling down. 
 Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at ya, 
 Smile for the camera if they're all about to trash ya. 
 Smile for the camera (camera, camera) 
 Smile for the camera, who's gonna catch ya? 
 You (you) 
 You (you), when you're falling down, the world starts spinning round. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, now it's not all about. 
 You (you), when you're falling down, you know I'll be around. 
 You're falling down, falling down 
 Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at you, 
 Smile for the camera 'cause they're all about to trash ya.
