Watch all the flowers 
 Dance with the wind 
 Listen to snowflakes 
 Whisper your name 
 Feel all the wonder 
 Lifting your dreams 
 You can fly 
 Fly to who you are 
 Climb upon your star 
 You believe you'll find your wings 
 Fly to your heart 
 Touch every rainbow 
 Painting the sky 
 Look at the magic 
 Glide through your life 
 A sprinkle of pixie dust 
 Circles the night 
 You can fly 
 Fly to who you are 
 Climb upon your star 
 You believe you'll find your wings 
 Fly 
 Everywhere you go 
 Your soul will find a home 
 You'll be free 
 To spread your wings 
 Fly 
 You can fly 
 To your heart 
 Fly to the heights of all you can be 
 Soar on the hope of marvelous things 
 Fly to who you are 
 Climb upon your star 
 You believe you'll find your wings 
 Fly 
 Everywhere you go 
 Your soul will find a home 
 You'll be free 
 To spread your wings 
 Fly 
 You can fly 
 To your heart
