A word's just a word 
 Till you mean what you say 
 And love isn't love 
 Until you give it away 
 We got a gift 
 Something to give 
 To make a change 
 Send it on 
 On and on 
 Just one that can heal another 
 Be a part 
 Reacd your heart 
 Just one spark starts a fire 
 With one little action 
 The chain reaction will never stop 
 Make it strong 
 Shine a light and send it on 
 Just smile 
 And the world 
 Will smile along with you 
 That small act of love 
 Is meant for one 
 Will become two 
 If we take the chances 
 To change circumstances 
 Imagine what we can do 
 If we 
 Send it on 
 On and on 
 Just one that can heal another 
 Be a part 
 Read your heart 
 Just one spark starts a fire 
 With one little action 
 The chain reaction will never stop 
 Make it strong 
 Shine a light and send it on 
 There's power in love 
 And the choices we make 
 So I'm starting now 
 There's not a moment to waste 
 A word's just a word 
 Till you mean what you say 
 And love isn't love 
 Until you give it away 
 Send it on 
 On and on 
 Just one that can heal another 
 Be a part 
 Read your heart 
 Just one spark starts a fire 
 With one little action 
 The chain reaction will never stop 
 Make it strong 
 Shine a light and send it on 
 Send it on 
 On and on 
 Just one that can heal another 
 Be a part 
 Reacd your heart 
 Just one spark starts a fire 
 With one little action 
 The chain reaction 
 A helping start 
 Make it strong 
 Shine a light and send it on
