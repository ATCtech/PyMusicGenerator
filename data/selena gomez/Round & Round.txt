Round and round 
 Round and round 
 Round and round 
 Round and round 
 You see me standing there 
 And act like you don't know me, 
 But last night you were calling me 
 Saying you want me. 
 Oh, why you always make me feel 
 Like I'm the one that's crazy. 
 You got my heart racing, 
 My, my heart racing. 
 Boy, I need you here with me, 
 We can't go on this way. 
 I'm falling hard for you 
 All I can say. 
 We're going 
 Round and round. 
 We're never gonna stop going 
 Round and round. 
 We'll never get where we are going 
 Round and round. 
 Well your gonna miss me, 
 'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
 Going round and round, and round 
 You tried to pull me close 
 And whisper in my ear. 
 You always told me lies, 
 I cried out all my tears. 
 I pushed my feelings to the side 
 But then you bring them back. 
 Bri-bring them back. 
 Now you got me singing. 
 Boy, I need you here with me, 
 We can't go on this way. 
 I'm falling hard for you, 
 All I can say. 
 We're going 
 Round and round. 
 We're never gonna stop going 
 Round and round. 
 We'll never get where we are going 
 Round and round. 
 Well your gonna miss me, 
 'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
 Going round and round, and round. 
 Love me or love me not, 
 I'm starring at the clock. 
 I take them flower petals off 
 And then I watch them drop. 
 Love me or love me not, 
 I'm starring at the clock. 
 I take them flower petals off 
 And then I watch them drop. 
 Boy, I need you here with me 
 I can't go on this way 
 I'm falling hard for you 
 All I can say 
 We're going 
 Round and round. 
 We're never gonna stop going 
 Round and round. 
 We'll never get where we're going 
 Round and round. 
 Well your gonna miss me, 
 'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
 Going round and round, and round. 
 We're never gonna stop going 
 Round and round. 
 We're never gonna get where we're going 
 Round and round. 
 Well you're all gonna miss me, 
 'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
 Going round and round, and round. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
