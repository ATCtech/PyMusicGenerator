Well you know everything's gonna be a breeze 
 That the end will no doubt justify the means 
 You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease 
 (Yes please) 
 When you might find out 
 It'll go to your head 
 When you write a report 
 On a book you never read 
 With the snap of your fingers 
 You can make your bed 
 That's what I said 
 Everything is not what it seems 
 When you can get all you wanted 
 In your wildest dreams 
 You might run into trouble 
 If you go to extremes 
 Because everything is not what it seems 
 Everything is not what it seems 
 When you can have what you want 
 By the simplest of means 
 Be careful not to mess with the balance of things 
 Because everything is not what it seems
