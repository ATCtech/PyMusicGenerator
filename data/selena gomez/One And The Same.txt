(Hey!, hey!, hey!) 
 La, la, la 
 (Hey!, hey!, hey!) 
 (Selena) 
 You come from here 
 I come from there 
 (DEMI) 
 You rock out in your room 
 I rock a world premiere 
 (Selena) 
 We're more alike 
 Than anybody could ever tell 
 (DEMI) 
 Friday we're cool 
 Monday we're freaks 
 (Selena) 
 Sometimes we're cool 
 Sometimes we can't even speak 
 (DEMI) 
 But we kick it up 
 And let loose in lol 
 (Selena) 
 It might seem cliche 
 For me to wanna say 
 That you're not alone 
 (DEMI) 
 And you can call me uncool 
 But it's a simple fact 
 I got your back 
 (Demi and selena) 
 'Cause we're one and the same 
 We're anything but ordinary 
 One and the same 
 I think we're almost legendary 
 You and me the perfect team 
 Chasing down the dream 
 We're one and the same 
 La, la, la 
 (DEMI) 
 I'm kinda like you 
 Your kinda like me 
 (Selena) 
 We right the same song 
 In a different key 
 (Demi and selena) 
 It's got a rhythm 
 You and me can get along 
 (Selena) 
 And it may seem cliche 
 For me to wanna say 
 That you're not alone 
 (Here I go again) 
 (DEMI) 
 And you can call me uncool 
 But I still got your back 
 (Demi and selena) 
 'Cause we're one and the same 
 We're anything but ordinary 
 One and the same 
 I think we're almost legendary 
 You and me the perfect team 
 Chasing down the dream 
 We're one and the same 
 'Cause we're one and the same 
 We're anything but ordinary 
 One and the same 
 We're something more than momentary 
 'Cause we're one 
 'Cause we're one 
 We're anything but ordinary 
 You and me the perfect team 
 Chasing down the dream 
 You and me the perfect team 
 Shaking up the scene 
 We're one and the same 
 La, la, la 
 (Hey!, hey!, hey!)
