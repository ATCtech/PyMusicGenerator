The club isnt the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me Ill give it a chance now
Take my hand stop put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now Im singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy dont mind me
Say boy lets not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

Im in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
Im in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Im in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
Im in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
Im in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
Im in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
Im in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
Were going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and Im singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy dont mind me
Say boy lets not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

Im in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
Im in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Im in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
Im in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
Im in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
Im in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
Im in love with the shape of you

Come on be my baby come on

Come on be my baby come on
Come on be my baby come on
Come on be my baby come on
Come on be my baby come on
Come on be my baby come on
Come on be my baby come on

Im in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
Im in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Im in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on
