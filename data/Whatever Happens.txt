He gives another smile tries to understand her side 
 To show that he cares she cant stay in the room 
 Shes consumed with everything thats been goin on 
 She says 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Everything will be alright he assures her 
 But she doesnt hear a word that he says 
 Preoccupied shes afraid 
 Afraid what theyve been doins not right 
 He doesnt know what to say so he prays 
 Whatever whatever whatever 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont you let go of my hand 
 Dont let go of my hand 
 Dont let go of my hand 
 Hes working day and night thinks hell make her happy 
 Forgetting all the dreams that he had 
 He doesnt realize its not the end of the world 
 It doesnt have to be that bad 
 She tried to explain Its you that makes me happy 
 Whatever whatever whatever 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont you let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont you let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont you let go of my hand 
 Whatever happens dont let go of my hand
