Never try to talk about it   Its got to sound good to me inside   I just think about it   Im so undemanding   Cause they say love is blind   Ive lived this life pretending   I can bear this hurt deep inside   The truth is that Im longing   For love thats so divine   Ive searched this whole world wishing   Shell be there time after time   So someone put your hand out   Im begging for your love   All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love   Ive lived my life the lonely   A soul that cries of shame   With handicapped emotions   Save me now from what still remains   Ill be your story hero   A serenading ryne   Im just needing that someone   Save me now from the path Im on   Someone put your hand out   Im begging for your love   Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love   Someone put your hand out   Im begging for your love   All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love   When you say we will dance til the light of day   Its just like the children in earths joy   When we pray will you promise me youll always stay   Its because Im needing that someone   Someone put your hand out   Im begging for your love   Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love   Someone put your hand out   Im begging for your love   All I do is hand out   Someone put your hand out   Im begging for your love   All I do is hand out   Love
