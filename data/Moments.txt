Shut the door turn the light off   I wanna be with you   I wanna feel your love   I wanna lay beside you   I cannot hide this even though I try   Heart beats harder   Time escapes me   Trembling hands touch skin   It makes this harder   And the tears stream down my face   If we could only have this life for one more day   If we could only turn back time   You know Ill be   Your life your voice your reason to be   My love my heart   Is breathing for this   Moment in time   Ill find the words to say   Before you leave me today   Close the door   Throw the key   Dont wanna be reminded   Dont wanna be seen   Dont wanna be without you   My judgements clouded   Like tonights sky   Hands are silent   Voice is numb   Try to scream out my lungs   It makes this harder   And the tears stream down my face   If we could only have this life for one more day   If we could only turn back time   You know Ill be   Your life your voice your reason to be   My love my heart   Is breathing for this   Moment in time   Ill find the words to say   Before you leave me today   Flashing lights in my mind   Going back to the time   Playing games in the street   Kicking balls with my feet   Theres a numb in my toes   Standing close to the edge   Theres a pile of my clothes   At the end of your bed   As I feel myself fall   Make a joke of it all   You know Ill be   Your life your voice your reason to be   My love my heart   Is breathing for this   Moment in time   Ill find the words to say   Before you leave me today   You know Ill be   Your life your voice your reason to be   My love my heart   Is breathing for this   Moment in time   Ill find the words to say   Before you leave me today
