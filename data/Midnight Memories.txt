 Straight off the plane to a new hotel 
 Just touched down you could never tell 
 Big house party with a crowded kitchen 
 People talk shh but we dont listen 
 Tell me that Im wrong but I do what I please 
 Way too many people in the Addison Lee 
 Now Im at the age when I know what I need oh whoa 
 Midnight memories oh oh oh 
 Baby you and me 
 Stumbling in the street 
 Singing singing singing singing 
 Midnight memories oh oh oh 
 Anywhere we go 
 Never say no 
 Just do it do it do it do it 
 5 foot something with the skinny jeans 
 Dont look back baby follow me 
 I dont know where Im going but Im finding my way 
 Same old shh but a different day 
 Tell me that Im wrong but I do what I please 
 Way too many people in the Addison Lee 
 Now Im at the age when I know what I need oh whoa 
 Midnight memories oh oh oh 
 Baby you and me 
 Stumbling in the street 
 Singing singing singing singing 
 Midnight memories oh oh oh 
 Anywhere we go 
 Never say no 
 Just do it do it do it 
 You and me and all our friends 
 I dont care how much we spend 
 Baby this is what the night is for 
 I know nothings making sense 
 For tonight lets just pretend 
 I dont wanna stop so give me more 
 Oh whoa 
 Midnight memories oh oh oh 
 Baby you and me 
 Stumbling in the street 
 Singing singing singing singing 
 Midnight memories oh oh oh 
 Anywhere we go 
 Never say no 
 Just do it do it do it do it
