They say Im different 
 They dont understand 
 But theres a bigger problem 
 Thats much more in demand 
 You got world hunger 
 Not enough to eat 
 So theres really no time 
 To be trippin on me 
 You got school teachers 
 Who dont wanna teach 
 You got grown people 
 Who cant write or read 
 You got strange diseases 
 Ah but theres no cure 
 You got many doctors 
 That arent so sure 
 So tell me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Stop trippin 
 Weve got more problems 
 Than well ever need 
 You got gang violence 
 And bloodshed on the street 
 You got homeless people 
 With no food to eat 
 With no clothes on their back 
 And no shoes for their feet 
 Weve got drug addiction 
 In the minds of the weak 
 Weve got so much corruption 
 Police brutality 
 Weve got streetwalkers 
 Walkin into darkness 
 Tell me 
 What are you doing 
 To try to stop this 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Stop trippin 
 Yeah stop tripin 
 Everybody just stop tripin 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Stop trippin 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Ooh stop trippin 
 Yeah stop trippin 
 Everybody just stop trippin 
 Stop trippin 
 Stop trippin 
 Stop trippin 
 Stop trippin 
 Stop trippin 
 Stop trippin 
 Stop trippin

 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Stop trippin 
 Why you wanna trip on me
