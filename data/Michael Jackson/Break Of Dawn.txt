Hold my hand feel the touch of your body cling to mine 
 You and me makin love all the way through another night 
 I remember you and I walking through the park at night 
 Kiss and touch nothing much let it blow just touch and go 
 Love me more never leave me alone by house of love 
 People talk people say what we have is just a game

 I dont want the sun to shine I wanna make love 
 Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart 
 I dont know what Im gonna do I cant stop lovin you

 Hold my hand feel the sweat yes youve got me nervous yet 
 Let me groove let me soothe let me take you on a cruise 
 Theres imagination I bet youve never been there before
