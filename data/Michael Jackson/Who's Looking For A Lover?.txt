Whos? Looking For A Lover? 
 Whos? Looking For A Lover? 
 Early this morning while I was yawning 
 I got a warning thought 
 Somebody near me who doesnt fear me 
 Knows things I aint been taught 
 Somebody older Somebody somebody bolder 
 Wants to get hold to me yeah 
 Wants to get hold to me 
 Somebody smart wants my young heart 
 I will a start I will a start 
 Whos Looking For A Lover? 
 Wholl pick me out from all the crowd? 
 What thrills will I discover? 
 Why love is scared or do myself proud?

 Maybe some honey just wants my money 
 Hey thats a funny tought 
 Someone appealing could set me reeling 
 And get my feelings caught 
 Somebody older Somebody somebody bolder Somebody 
 Wants to get hold to me yeah 
 Wants to get hold to me 
 Somebody strong help me belong
