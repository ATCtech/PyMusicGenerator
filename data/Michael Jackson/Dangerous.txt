The way she came into the place I knew right then and there 
 There was something different about this girl the way she moved 
 Her hair her face her lines divinity in motion 
 As she stalked the room I could feel the aura of her presence 
 Every head turned feeling passion and lust 
 The girl was persuasive the girl I could not trust 
 The girl was bad the girl was dangerous 
 I never knew but I was walking the line 
 Come go with me I said I have no time 
 And dont you pretend we didnt talk on the phone 
 My baby cried she left me standing alone 
 Shes so dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but youre no damn good for me 
 She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire 
 I fell trapped into her web of sin 
 A touch a kiss a whisper of love 
 I was at the point of no return 
 Deep in the darkness of passions insanity 
 I felt taken by lusts strange inhumanity 
 This girl was persuasive this girl I could not trust 
 The girl was bad the girl was dangerous 
 I never knew but I was living in vain 
 She called my house she said you know my name 
 And dont you pretend you never did me before 
 With tears in her eyes my baby walked out the door 
 Shes so dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but youre no damn good for me 
 Dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 I have to pray to God 
 Cause I know how lust can blind 
 Its a passion in my soul 
 But youre no damn lover friend of mine 
 I can not sleep alone tonight 
 My baby left me here tonight 
 I can not cope till its all right 
 You and your manipulation 
 You hurt my baby 
 And then it happened she touched me 
 For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb 
 And her mouth was smoother than oil 
 But her inner spirit and words 
 Were as sharp as a twoedged sword 
 But I loved it cause its dangerous 
 Shes so dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but youre no damn good for me 
 Shes so dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but youre no damn good for me 
 Shes so dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but youre no damn good for me 
 Dangerous the girl is so dangerous 
 I have to pray to God 
 Cause I know how lust can blind 
 Its a passion in my soul 
 But youre no damn lover friend of mine
