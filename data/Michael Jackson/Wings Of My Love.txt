When this old world gets you down 
 When your spirits on the ground 
 Just remember I will always be around 
 Just climb on the wings of my love 
 Ill take you high on the wings of my love 
 When youre feeling all alone 
 Like a child whos got no home 
 You know youve always got a place where you can go 
 Just climb on the wings of my love 
 Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
 As it rushes to the seas darling well be just as free 
 Ill lift your spirits high our love will fly 
 Well have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 
 Til you break those ties that bind 
 Til that day youre really mine 
 Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
 Just climb on the wings of my love 
 Ill lift your spirits high our love will fly 
 Well have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 
 Weve got rainbows yet to find 
 And well find them all in time 
 Girl you know someday well even touch the sky 
 Just climb on the wings of my love 
 Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
 Ill take you high on the wings of my love 
 Just take my hand and together well touch the sky 
 Just climb on the wings of my love 
 Yes remember I will always be around 
 Ill take you high on the wings of my love
