She dances in the sheets at nights 
 She dances to his needs 
 She dances till he feels just right 
 Until he falls asleep 
 She dances at the crack of dawn 
 And quickly cooks his food 
 She cant be late cant take too long 
 The kids must get to school 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm of 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 A a slave to the rhythm of 
 The rhythm of love the rhythm of love 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm of 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 A a slave to the rhythm of 
 The rhythm of love the rhythm of love 
 She dances for the man at work 
 Who works her overtime 
 She cant be rude as she says 
 Sir I must be home tonight 
 She dances to the kitchen stove 
 Dinner is served by nine 
 He says his foods an hour late 
 She must be outta her mind 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm of 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 A a slave to the rhythm of 
 The rhythm of love the rhythm of love 
 She works so hard just to make her way 
 For a man who just dont appreciate 
 And though he takes her love in vain 
 Still she could not stop couldnt break his chains 
 She danced the night that they fell out 
 She swore shed dance no more 
 But dance she did he did not quit 
 As she ran out the door 
 She danced through the night in fear of her life 
 She danced to a beat of her own 
 She let out a cry and swallowed her pride 
 She knew she was needed back home home 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm of 
 Shes a slave to the rhythm 
 A a slave to the rhythm of 
 The rhythm of love the rhythm of love
