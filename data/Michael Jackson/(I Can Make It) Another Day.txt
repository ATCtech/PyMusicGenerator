My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars 
 And youre the only one that could take me this far 
 Ill be forever searching for your love 
 Huhooh 
 I walked away but I was wrong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the one that keeps me strong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the fire that keeps me warm 
 I cant make it another day 
 How did I get through this storm 
 I cant make it another day without your love 
 Hoo hoo 
 Come on now 
 At night 
 I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you 
 Finding you 
 Ive opened up my heart I want you to come through 
 Ive close my eyes Im searching for your love 
 Huhooh 
 I walked away but I was wrong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the one that keeps me strong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the fire that keeps me warm 
 I cant make it another day 
 How did I get through this storm 
 I cant make it another day without your love 
 I walked away but I was wrong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the one that keeps me strong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the fire that keeps me warm 
 I cant make it another day 
 How did I get through this storm 
 I cant make it another day without your love 
 Come on now 
 I walked away but I was wrong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the one that keeps me strong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the fire that keeps me warm 
 I cant make it another day 
 How did I get through this storm? 
 I cant make it another day without your love 
 I walked away but I was wrong

 Youre the one that keeps me strong 
 I cant make it another day 
 Youre the fire that keeps me warm 
 I cant make it another day
