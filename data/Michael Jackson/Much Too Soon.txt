She was there just sitting at the table 
 Thinking how that things wont be the same 
 And would you like to go with me 
 And she would answer no to me 
 I guess I learned my lesson much too soon 
 I never thought 
 Shed leave me here forever 
 But who knows just what the future brings 
 And would you like to go with me 
 And she answered no to me 
 I guess I learned my lesson much too soon 
 Take away this never ending sorrow 
 Take this lonely feeling from my soul 
 If only I knew what things bring tomorrow 
 Shed be sitting here beside me 
 And my heart would fill with gold 
 I hope to make a change now 
 For the better 
 Never letting fate control my soul 
 And hoping that my prayers will see 
 The day that youll come back to me 
 But I guess I learned my lesson 
 Much too soon 
 Yes I guess I learned my lesson 
 Much too soon
