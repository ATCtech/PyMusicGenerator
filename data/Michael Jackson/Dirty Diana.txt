Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Youll never make me stay 
 So take your weight off of me 
 I know your every move 
 So wont you just let me be 
 Ive been here times before 
 But I was too blind to see 
 That you seduce every man 
 This time you wont seduce me 
 Shes saying thats ok 
 Hey baby do what you please 
 I have the stuff that you want 
 I am the thing that you need 
 She looked me deep in the eyes 
 Shes touching me so to start 
 She says theres no turning back 
 Shes trapped me in her heart 
 Dirty Diana nah 
 Dirty Diana nah 
 Dirty Diana no 
 Dirty Diana 
 Let me be 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 She likes the boys in the band 
 She knows when they come to town 
 Every musicians fan 
 After the curtain comes down 
 She waits at backstage doors 
 For those who have prestige 
 Who promise fortune and fame 
 A life thats so carefree 
 Shes saying thats ok 
 Hey baby do what you want 
 Ill be your night loving thing 
 Ill be the freak you can taunt 
 I dont care what you say 
 I want to go too far 
 Ill be your everything 
 If you make me a star

 She said I have to go home 
 Cause Im real tired you see 
 Now I hate sleeping alone 
 Why dont you come with me 
 I said my babys at home 
 Shes probably worried tonight 
 I didnt call on the phone 
 To say that Im alright 
 Diana walked up to me 
 She said Im all yours tonight 
 At that I ran to the phone 
 Saying Baby Im alright 
 I said but unlock the door 
 Cause I forgot the key 
 She said hes not coming back 
 Because hes sleeping with me
