 Whos looking for a lover? 
 Early this morning while I was yawning 
 I got a warning thought 
 Somebody near me who doesnt fear me 
 Knows things I aint been taught 
 Somebody older somebody bolder 
 Wants to get hold of me yeah 
 Somebody smart wants my young heart 
 Our will is done our will is done 
 Whos looking for a lover? 
 Wholl pick me out from all the crowd? 
 What thrills will I discover? 
 Will I be scared or do myself proud? 
 Whos looking for a lover? 
 Whos looking for a lover? 
 Maybe some honey just wants my money 
 Hey thats a funny tought 
 Someone appealing could set me reeling 
 And get my feeling caught 
 Somebody older somebody bolder 
 Wants to get hold of me yeah 
 Somebody strong help me belong 
 Answer my song answer my song 
 Whos looking for a lover?
