There goes the sunshine 
 Here comes the rain 
 And heartache pain 
 What can I do but wait for you? 
 Darling the days 
 I had were cold 
 Now our separate ways we go 
 It seems you want more 
 Than the love I can give 
 But I cant make you stay 
 And youve got your life to live 
 But if it gets too rough 
 Call on me 
 Dreams of golden glare 
 Taking you away from here 
 But if ever things that have to be 
 Turns your dreams around 
 Love and understanding is what you need 
 If you cant get enough 
 Call on me 
 Im so sad youre leaving 
 Its gonna to kill me 
 Not to be with you 
 But I want you to be happy 
 If heartaches what you want 
 Then I want it too 
 So goodbye with all my prayers 
 For your happiness in a world elsewheree 
 Should you arrive and its not there 
 Call on me call on me 
 Yes happiness 
 Waits for you elsewhere 
 Remember this 
 Should you arrive and its not there 
 Call on me call on me 
 Yes happiness 
 Waits for you elsewhere 
 Remember this 
 Should you arrive and its not there 
 Call on me call on me 
 Fade
