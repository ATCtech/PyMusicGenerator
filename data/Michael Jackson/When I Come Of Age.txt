Where have I been? 
 What should I be looking for? 
 What am I gonna be when I come of age? 
 Will I be strong? 
 Will I de a mighty man 
 Climb mountains if I can 
 When I come of age? 
 Hey yall I think Ill be a movie star 
 Or travel to some distant star 
 Yeah thats it Im gonna be an astronaut 
 And rock it to the moon 
 And then Ill be the captain of a giant ship 
 Im gonna take a long long trip to far off land 
 When I become a man 
 And what about love? 
 Will you still be in love with me? 
 I sure hope you will be 
 When I come of age 
 And will you be true? 
 Will you still want to marry me? 
 I guess Ill have to wait and see 
 When I come of age 
 My folks say Im too young for love 
 But they dont seem to understand 
 That what I feel is love for somebody 
 A feeling I understand 
 And while Ive fot this feeling 
 Its you girl youre so grand 
 And Ill love you girl just as strong 
 When I come of age 
 Wait be patient honey 
 Youve got to believe in me 
 Wait wait for me baby 
 Itll be just you and me 
 Well do all the things 
 We couldnt do before 
 When when I come of age 
 Were gonna be so happy 
 When when I come of age
