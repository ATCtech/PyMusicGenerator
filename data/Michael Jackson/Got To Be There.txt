Got to be there got to be there 
 In the morning 
 When she says hello to the world 
 Got to be there got to be there 
 Bring her good times 
 And show her that shes my girl 
 Oh what a feeling therell be 
 The moment I know she loves me 
 Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
 I need her sharing her world beside me 
 So Ive got to be there 
 Got to be there in the morning 
 And welcome her into my world 
 And show her that she is my girl 
 When she says Hello world 
 I need her sharing the world beside me 
 Thats why Ive got to be there 
 Got to be there where love begins 
 And thats everywhere she goes 
 Ive got to be there so she knows 
 That when shes with me shes home 
 Got to be there 
 Got to be there
