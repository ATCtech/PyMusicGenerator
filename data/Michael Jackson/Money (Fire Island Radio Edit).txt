Die for it 
 So you call it trust 
 But I say its just 
 In the devils game 
 Of greed and lust 
 They dont care 
 Theyd do me for the money 
 They dont care 
 They use me for the money 
 So you go to church 
 Read the Holy Word 
 In the scheme of life 
 Its all absurd 
 They dont care 
 Theyd kill for the money 
 Do or dare 
 The thrill for the money 
 Youre saluting the flag 
 Your country trusts you 
 Now youre wearing a badge 
 Youre called the Just Few 
 And youre fighting the wars 
 A soldier must do 
 Ill never betray or deceive you my friend but 
 If you show me the cash 
 Then I will take it 
 If you tell me to cry 
 Then I will fake it 
 If you give me a hand 
 Then I will shake it 
 You would do anything for money 
 Anything 
 Anything 
 Anything for money 
 Id lie for you 
 Would die for you I 
 Even sell my soul to the devil 
 Anything 
 Anything 
 Anything for money 
 Id lie for you 
 Would die for you I 
 Even sell my soul to the devil 
 Insurance 
 Where do your loyalties lie 
 Is that your alibi 
 I dont think so 
 You dont care 
 Youd do her for the money 
 Say its fair 
 You sue her for the money 
 Want your pot of gold 
 Need the Midas touch 
 Bet you sell your soul 
 Cause your God is such 
 You dont care 
 You kill for the money 
 Do or dare 
 The thrill for the money 
 Are you infected with the same disease 
 Of lust gluttony and greed 
 Then watch the ones 
 With the biggest smiles 
 The idle jabbers 
 Cause theyre the backstabbers 
 If you know its a lie 
 Then you will swear it 
 If you give it with guilt 
 Then you will bear it 
 If its taking a chance 
 Then you will dare it 
 You would do anything for money 
 Anything 
 Anything 
 Anything for money 
 Id lie for you 
 Would die for you I 
 Even sell my soul to the devil

 If you show me the man 
 Then I will sell him 
 If you ask me to lie 
 Then I will tell him 
 If its dealing with God 
 Then you will hell him
