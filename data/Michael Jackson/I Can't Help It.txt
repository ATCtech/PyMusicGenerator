Looking in my mirror 
 Took me by surprise 
 I cant help but see you 
 Running often through my mind 
 Helpless like a baby 
 Sensual disguise 
 I cant help but love you 
 Its getting better all the time 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it even if I could 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it no 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it even if I could 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it no 
 Love to run my fingers 
 Softly while you sigh 
 Love came and possessed you 
 Bringing sparkles to your eyes 
 Like a trip to heaven 
 Heaven is the prize 
 And Im so glad I found you girl 
 Youre an angel in disguise 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it even if I could 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it no 
 And Im so glad I found you girl 
 Youre an angel in disguise 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it even if I could 
 I cant help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldnt help it no
