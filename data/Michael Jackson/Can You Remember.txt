Can you remember 
 When we were babies? 
 We were always together 
 When we were kindergartners 
 Now that youre grown girl 
 You left me all alone 
 And you know Ill never find 
 No one to call my own 
 So girl I love you I love you 
 Dont you know I love you? 
 My Cherie like for you 
 To remember if you can 
 Times we had and the time we shared 
 Sitting there in the grass 
 Can you remember 
 When we were babies? 
 We were always together 
 And I never had no one but you 
 When sunny skies are blue girl 
 Youll know that I love you 
 And Ill always promise you 
 That this is what Ill do 
 So girl I love you I love you 
 Dont you know I love you? 
 My Cherie like for you 
 To remember if you can 
 Times we had and the time we shared 
 Sitting there in the grass
