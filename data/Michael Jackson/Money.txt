Money 
 Lie for it 
 Spy for it 
 Kill for it 
 Die for it 
 So you call it trust but I say its just 
 In the devils game of greed and lust 
 They dont care theyd do me for the money 
 They dont care they use me for the money 
 So you go to church read the holy word 
 In the scheme of life its all absurd 
 They dont care theyd kill for the money 
 Do or dare the thrill for the money 
 Youre saluting the flag your country trusts you 
 Now youre wearing a badge youre called the Just Few 
 And youre fighting the wars a soldier must do 
 Ill never betray or deceive you my friend but 
 If you show me the cash then I will take it 
 If you tell me to cry then I will fake it 
 If you give me a hand then I will shake it 
 Youll do anything for money 
 Anything anything 
 Anything for money 
 Would lie for you would die for you ah 
 Even sell my soul to the devil ah 
 Anything anything 
 Anything for money 
 Would lie for you would die for you ah 
 Even sell my soul to the devil 
 Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie? 
 Is that your alibi? I dont think so 
 You dont care youd do her for the money 
 Say its fair you sue her for the money 
 Want your pot of gold need the Midas touch 
 Bet you sell your soul cause your God is such 
 You dont care you kill for the money 
 Do or dare the thrill for the money 
 Are you infected with the same disease of lust gluttoney and greed? 
 Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles the idle jabbers 
 Cause theyre the backstabbers 
 If you know its a lie then you will swear it 
 If you give it with guilt then you will bear it 
 If its taking a chance then you will dare it 
 Youll do anything for money 
 Anything anything 
 Anything for money 
 Would lie for you would die for you ah

 You say you wouldnt do it for all the money in the world
