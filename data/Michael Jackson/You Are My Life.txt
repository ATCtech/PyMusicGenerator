Once all alone 
 I was lost in a world of strangers 
 No one to trust 
 On my own I was lonely 
 You suddenly appeared 
 It was cloudy before but now its all clear 
 You took away the fear 
 You brought me back to light 
 You are the sun You are the sun 
 You make me shine You make me shine 
 Or more like the stars Stars 
 That that twinkle at night twinkle at night 
 You are the moon You are the moon 
 That glows in my heart That glows in my heart 
 Youre my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are my life You are my life 
 Now I wake up everyday 
 With this smile upon my face 
 No more tears no more pain 
 Cause you love me 
 You help me understand 
 That love is the answer to all that I am 
 And Im a better man 
 Since you taught me by sharing your life 
 You are the sun You are the sun 
 You make me shine You make me shine 
 Or more like the stars Stars 
 That that twinkle at night twinkle at night 
 You are the moon You are the moon 
 That glows in my heart That glows in my heart 
 Youre my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are the sun You are the sun 
 You make me shine You make me shine 
 Or more like the stars Stars 
 That that twinkle at night twinkle at night 
 You are the moon You are the moon 
 That glows in my heart That glows in my heart 
 Youre my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You gave me strength 
 When I wasnt strong I wasnt strong 
 You gave me hope when all hope is lost 
 You opened my eyes when I couldnt see I couldnt see 
 Love was always here waiting for me me~ 
 You are the sun You are the sun 
 You make me shine You make me shine 
 Or more like the stars Stars 
 That that twinkle at night twinkle at night 
 You are the moon You are the moon 
 That glows in my heart That glows in my heart 
 Youre my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are the sun You are the sun 
 You make me shine You make me shine 
 Or more like the stars More like the stars 
 That that twinkle the night time at night twinkle at night I love you 
 You are the moon All right now 
 You are the sun That glows in my heart 
 Youre my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are the sun You are the sun 
 You make me shine You make me shine 
 Or more like the stars More like the stars 
 That that twinkle the night time at night twinkle at night I love you 
 You are the moon You are the moon 
 That glows in my heart That glows in my heart 
 Youre my daytime my night time 
 My world 
 You are my life
