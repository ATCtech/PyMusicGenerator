Shes got the look 
 Shes so fine 
 And you know damn well 
 The girl will be mine 
 Shes got the breaks 
 Shes the scene 
 And you know damn well 
 She gives it to me 
 Black jeans and 
 A turtleneck sweater 
 I know the girl 
 Is fakin cause 
 Ive seen her look better 
 Shes composition 
 Shes statistical fact 
 Shes got it ready 
 For the willing 
 Got it kicking in the back 
 Shes got the look 
 Ought to know better 
 Shes got the look 
 Shes driving me wild 
 Shes got the look 
 Ought to know better 
 Shes got the look 
 Shes driving me wild 
 Come to the place 
 Shock to see 
 And you know damn well 
 You know what I mean 
 Hot in the face 
 One to three 
 Like a pleasure trip 
 Like youve never seen 
 Satin lace 
 And a paisley cut top 
 The girl is wasting over 
 Cause she knows she looks hot 
 Shes got position 
 Shes got just what it takes 
 Got a mojo 
 In her pocket 
 Got it ready 
 Just in case 
 Shes got the look 
 Ought to know better 
 Shes got the look 
 Shes driving me wild 
 Shes got the look 
 Ought to know better

 Shes driving me wild

 Youre drivin me wild

 You got me lookin like buckwheat oh 
 Hair pulled every which way but me 
 Far from a Drusilla ? your lips are deadly 
 Youre walkin soft still I hear the medley 
 Uh she bought me timberland boots cramped my style 
 She drives me wild 
 Shes got the look
