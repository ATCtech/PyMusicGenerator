Love was taken from a young life 
 And no one told her why 
 Her direction has a dimlight 
 From one more violent crime 
 She innocently questioned why 
 Why her father had to die 
 She asked the men in blue 
 How is it that you get to choose 
 Who will live and who will die 
 Did god say that you could decide? 
 You saw he didnt run 
 And then my daddy had no gun 
 In the middle of a village 
 Within a distant land 
 Lies a poor boy with his broken toy 
 Too young to understand 
 Hes awaken ground is shaking 
 His father grabs his hand 
 Screaming crying his wifes dying 
 Now hes left to explain 
 He innocently questioned why 
 Why his mother had to die 
 What did these soldiers come here for? 
 If theyre for peace why is there war? 
 Did god say that they could decide 
 Who will live and who will die? 
 All my mama ever did 
 Was try to take care of her kids 
 Were innocently standing by 
 Watching people losing lives 
 It seems as if we have no voice 
 Its time for us to make a choice 
 Only god could decide 
 Who will live and who will die 
 Theres nothing that cant be done 
 If we raise our voice as one 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 We cant take it 
 Weve already had enough 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 We cant take it 
 Weve already had enough 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from you baby? 
 We cant take it 
 Weve already had enough 
 Deep in my soul baby 
 Deep in your soul and by your side 
 Deep in my soul 
 Its so big and Im still alive 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 Whoooooo 
 We cant take it 
 Weve already had enough 
 Its going down baby 
 Just let God decide 
 Its going on baby 
 Just let God decide 
 Deep in my soul baby 
 Weve already had enough 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 We cant we cant 
 Weve already had enough
