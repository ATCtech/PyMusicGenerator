Into each life some rain falls 
 Then comes the snow 
 But after the snow 
 The flowers will grow 
 Girl when my life got stormy 
 You stayed for the ride 
 You stayed my side 
 You make the sun shine 
 Im up again I never let you down 
 Nothings ever gonna stop me now 
 Up again I never let you down 
 I love you 
 This Humpty Dumptys lucky 
 Hes had his fall 
 But after it all 
 He brushed himself off 
 Knowing how much you loved me 
 I made one more try 
 I reached for the sky 
 And I made it this time 
 Im up again I never let you down 
 Nothings ever gonna stop me now 
 Up again I never let you down 
 I love you
