When youre down and trubled 
 And you need some love and care 
 And nothin no nothin is goin right 
 Just close your eyes and think of me 
 And soon Ill be there to brighten up 
 Yeah even your darkest night 
 You just call out my name 
 And you know wherever I am 
 Ill come arunnin 
 To see you again 
 Winter spring summer or fall 
 All you have to do is call 
 And Ill be there yeah I will 
 Youve got a friend 
 When the sky above you 
 Grows dark and full of clouds 
 And that old north wind 
 He begins to blow 
 Heres what you do baby 
 Keep your head together 
 And call my name out loud 
 And soon youll hear me 
 Knockin at your door 
 Oh yes I will yes I will 
 You just call out my name 
 And you know wherever I am 
 Ill come arunnin 
 To see you again 
 Winter spring summer or fall 
 All you have to do is call 
 And Ill be there yeah I will 
 Youve got a friend 
 Aint it good to know 
 That youve got a friend 
 People can be so cold 
 Theyll hurt you and desert you 
 And take your soul if you let them 
 Oh dont let them 
 Winter spring summer or fall 
 All you have to do is call 
 And Ill be there yes I will 
 Youve got a friend yes you do 
 Youve got a friend yes you do 
 Right till the end for you 
 Aint it good to know
