Mind Is The Magic 
 Come in to me 
 I know mystical garden 
 Orchards and violets 
 All mysteries are parted 
 Life is a mirageghost 
 Imagination 
 Pure inspiration called justification 
 Nothings impossible 
 Nothings concealed 
 Everything here is for real 
 What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head? 
 Who creates wonders like nobody can? 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 You know its 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 So be it 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 Im gonna 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 When its Siegfried and Roy 
 Its the mind of a magic in true 
 Your own thoughts play the game 
 In the magical wonders they do 
 The mind in the magic is you 
 Move of the head 
 And Ill change your emotions 
 Strange things appear 
 From euphorics devotions 
 Everythings happening 
 Nothings unreal 
 Hallucinating the mind in the real 
 Seeing black panthers 
 That suddenly fly 
 White tigers stalking your mind 
 Hallucinating the things that you see 
 This kind of magics so hard to believe 
 Cause when its Siegfried and Roy 
 Its the mind of a magic in true 
 Your own thoughts play the game 
 In the magical wonders they do 
 The mind in the magic is you 
 When its Siegfried and Roy 
 Its the mind of a magic in true 
 When its Siegfried and Roy 
 Its the mind of a magic in true 
 Seeing is believin 
 When its Siegfried and Roy 
 Its the mind of a magic in true 
 Hallucinations 
 The game of this kind 
 This kind of magic 
 Throws mind
