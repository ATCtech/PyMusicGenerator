I am your joy   Your best of joy   I am the moonlight   You are the spring   Our loves a sacred thing   You know I always will love you   I am forever   I am the one who came when you fell down   I was the only one around   The only one   When things would hurt you   I am forever   Wasnt it I who said that you were free?   When living seemed so hard to be   When things would hurt you   I am forever   I am forever   We are forever   We are forever   I am your friend   Through thick and thin   We need each other   Well never part   Our love is from the heart   We never say I dont need you   We are forever   I am the one who said that you were free   When living seemed so hard to be   The only one   And nothing would cheer you   I am forever   Wasnt it I who carried you around?   When all the walls came tumbling down   And things would hurt you   I am forever   I am forever   We are forever   We are forever   You are the sun that lights up the sky   When things are shady   Let come what may we do get by   I was the only one around   The only one   When things would hurt you   We are forever   I am forever   We are forever   I am forever   We are forever   We are forever   We are forever   We are forever   I am forever   I am forever   We are forever   We are forever   I am forever   I am forever
