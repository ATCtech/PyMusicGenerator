Cant ever get it right 
 No matter how hard I try 
 And Ive tried 
 Well I put up a good fight 
 But your words cut like knives 
 And Im tired 
 As you break my heart 
 Again this time 
 Tell me Im a screwed up mess 
 Than I never listen listen 
 Tell me you dont want my kiss 
 That you need your distance distance 
 Tell me anything but dont you say 
 Hes what youre missing baby 
 If hes the reason 
 That youre leaving me tonight 
 Spare me what youre thinking 
 Tell me a lie 
 Well youre the charming type 
 That little twinkle in your eye 
 Gets me every time 
 And well there mustve been a time 
 I was a reason for that smile 
 So keep in mind 
 As you take whats left of You and I 
 Tell me Im a screwed up mess 
 Than I never listen listen 
 Tell me you dont want my kiss 
 That you need your distance distance 
 Tell me anything but dont you say 
 Hes what youre missing baby 
 If hes the reason 
 That youre leaving me tonight 
 Spare me what youre thinking 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me Im a screwed up mess 
 Than I never listen listen 
 Tell me you dont want my kiss 
 That you need your distance distance 
 Tell me anything but dont you say 
 Hes what youre missing baby 
 If hes the reason 
 That youre leaving me tonight 
 Spare me what youre thinking 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie 
 Tell me a lie
