Shock, horror, I'm down 
 Lost, your not around 
 There's a lump in my chest that 
 Sends cold through my head and 
 My mind shuts sound out 
 I'm on autopilot 
 And my tongues gone silent 
 Just switch it off and lay it down 
 Lay it down, next to me 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe when I made you mine 
 Woooooh oh 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe it was every time 
 That you said, you said, you saaaaaid 
 That I miss you 
 That I miss you 
 These words mean nothing to me 
 I'm just in on a fence of how it used to be 
 These three words, are aching 
 Constrict them, suffocating 
 My mind is racing 
 With the picture I'm painting 
 And my belly's sick to its stomach 
 When I remember all the times he was with you 
 When you laid it dowwwn 
 When you laid down, next to me 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe when I made you mine 
 Woooooh oh 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe it was every time 
 That you said, you said, you saaaaaid 
 That I miss you, more then I let on 
 I kissed you, far to long 
 I'll let go, as soon as you do 
 See I know, were not through 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe when I made you mine 
 Whoa oh 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe it was every time 
 That you said, you said, you saaaaid 
 That I miss you 
 That I miss you 
 Whoa 
 I don't know when I lost my mind 
 Maybe it was every time 
 That you said, you said, you saaaaaaid 
 That I miss you
