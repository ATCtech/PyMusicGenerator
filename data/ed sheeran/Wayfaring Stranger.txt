Ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 I am a poor wayfaring stranger 
 Travelling through, this world alone 
 There's no sickness, toil or danger 
 And that bright laight to which I go 
 And I'm going there to see my mother 
 And I'm going there no more to roam 
 I'm only going over jordan 
 I'm only going over home now 
 Hey-ey yeah 
 Ooh 
 I know dark clouds will gather me 
 I know my way's rough and steep 
 And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me 
 And I know my way's rough and steep 
 I'm going there to see my mother 
 I'm going there no more to roam 
 I'm only going over jordan 
 I'm only going over home now 
 'Cause I am a poor wayfaring stranger 
 Travelling through, this world alone 
 There's no sickness, toil or danger 
 And that bright laight to which I go 
 I'm going there to see my mother 
 I'm going there no more to roam 
 I'm only going over jordan 
 I'm only going home now
