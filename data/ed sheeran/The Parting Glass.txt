Of all the money that e'er I had, I spent it in good company 
 And of all the harm that e'er I've done, alas it was to none but me 
 And all I've done for want of wit, to memory now I can't recall 
 So fill to me the parting glass. goodnight and joy be with you all 
 Of all the comrades that e'er I had, they're sorry for my going away 
 And all the sweethearts that e'er I had 
 They would wish me one more day to stay 
 But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not 
 I'll gently rise and I'll softly call, "goodnight and joy be with you all!" 
 A man may drink and not be drunk, a man may fight and not be slain 
 A man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcomed back again 
 But since it has so ordered been by a time to rise and a time to fall 
 Come fill to me the parting glass, good night and joy be with you all 
 Good night and joy be with you all
