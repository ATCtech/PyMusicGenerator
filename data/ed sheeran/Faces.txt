Ho, oh 
 Faces change 
 But this place'll stay the same 
 And I'll know when I'll go 
 Home 
 Yeah 
 And I'm pickin' up another bag 
 And I pack another knapsack 
 The airport's like a stoplight to me 
 Sittin' on red, green light go 
 Can't see my family 
 My family grew into a globe of friends and fans 
 Or some may call 'em 
 And it's on the stage I stand 
 To jam, rock, sing 
 No wakin' up to stop the dream 
 I lived the life, signed a picture 
 'Cause no dam could stop the stream 
 Or floodgates, I'm in a fucked race 
 And a pocket fulla culture condoms 
 They put you on the podium for first place 
 But on the block, they judge you on 'em, so 
 Who got the South in a six-pack, and a shotgun just for show 
 I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth 
 Put the hood in mossy oak, I'm the 
 Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life 
 Beat me down with criticism 
 But at least the critic's write with a broken pen 
 There they go again 
 I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' gem 
 Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in 
 I'm goin' home, I'm home again 
 Bring it back up in the U.K. 
 With a Dixie flag and a sixty sack 
 Catfish Billy, hell you say 
 I'm just bein' blunt, homie, keep the grass 
 (Now bumper sticker that, drop a rap and change me) 
 And you changed me 
 Into what I am now 
 Oh, you made me 
 Into something I was always gonna be 
 It seems these broken dreams don't lie, ooh 
 And so now my broken wings won't fly 
 Yeah, take one look 
 Better yet, take two 
 But if I take that break, as a move you made 
 This dude you shape will come take you back 
 Back to the roots I've been 
 Without a fuckin' pot to pee in 
 Or a spot to sleep in 
 Hot or cold outside, it's not the season 
 'Cause I am not the reason 
 That the image you're used to seein' 
 Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless 
 Meaning yes, I'm different 
 Differently made 
 And me screamin' the A 
 Is not the difference in grades 
 It's the place I stayed 
 'Cause the schools were underpaid 
 The teachers taught, but to me they fought 
 The star that was underway 
 It was under Wayne, it was in my name 
 Michael, M.W.A 
 Atha, and in trouble I stayed 
 Breakin' out of this bubble they made 
 Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven 
 And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet 
 Fuck the world with a tattooed hand 
 Committed to the words I say 
 A bloodline's not a family tree 
 It's a needle in my skin for all to see 
 I ain't never got a spring break, tattooed drunk 
 But I drink and take the ink 
 (Shirts off, you can't, you can't change me) 
 And you changed me 
 Into what I am now 
 Oh, you made me 
 Into something I was always gonna be 
 It seems these broken dreams don't lie, ooh 
 And so now my broken wings won't fly
