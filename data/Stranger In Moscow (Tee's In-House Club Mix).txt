Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Were talkin danger 
 Were talkin danger baby 
 Like a stranger in Moscow 
 Were talkin danger 
 Were talkin danger baby 
 Like a stranger in Moscow 
 Im livin lonely 
 Im livin lonely baby 
 I was wandering in the rain 
 Mask of life feelin insane 
 Swift and sudden fall from grace 
 Sunny days seem far away 
 Kremlins shadow belittling me 
 Stalins tomb wont let me be 
 On and on and on it came 
 Wish the rain would just let me be 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 When youre alone 
 And youre cold inside 
 Here abandoned in my fame 
 Armageddon of the brain 
 KGB was doggin me 
 Take my name and just let me be 
 Then a begger boy called my name 
 Happy days will drown the pain 
 On and on and on it came 
 In the rain and again and again 
 Take my name and just let me be 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel now 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 When youre alone 
 And youre cold inside 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel now 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 When youre alone 
 And youre cold inside 
 Like a stranger in Moscow 
 Lord have mercy 
 Like a stranger in Moscow 
 Lord have mercy 
 Were talkin danger 
 Were talkin danger baby
