I cant live another day without your love   At night I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you   Ive opened up my heart I want you to come through   Ive closed my eyes Im searching for your love   I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How did I get through this storm?   I cant live another day without your love   I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How did I get through this storm?   I cant live another day without your love   Come on now   I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How did I get through this storm?
