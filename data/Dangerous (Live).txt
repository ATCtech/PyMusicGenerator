The way she came into the place I knew right then and there 
 There was something different about this girl 
 The way she moved 
 Her hair her face her lines 
 Divinity in motion 
 As she stalked the room I could feel the aura of her presence 
 Every head turned feeling passion and lust 
 The girl was persuasive 
 The girl I could not trust 
 The girl was bad 
 The girl was dangerous 
 She came at me in sections 
 With the eyes of desire 
 I fell trapped into her web of sin 
 A touch a kiss a whisper of love 
 I was at the point of no return 
 Deep in the darkness of passions insanity 
 I felt taken by lusts strange inhumanity 
 This girl was persuasive 
 This girl I could not trust 
 The girl was bad 
 The girl was dangerous 
 Youve been hit by 
 Youve been struck by 
 A Smooth Criminal 
 Spoken: You know you want me 
 Dangerous 
 The girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money 
 Throw away my time 
 You can call me honey 
 But youre no d good for me 
 Dangerous 
 The girl is so dangerous 
 I have to pray to God 
 Cause I know that lust can blind Its a passion in my soul 
 But youre no d lover friend of mine 
 My baby 
 You been 
 You take 
 Uh 
 You dont 
 You dont 
 Dont 
 You turn 
 My baby 
 Dangerous echo
