Weve got forever forever   Ill plant you a garden   Of laughter and tears   With rain and with sunshine   Love will grow through the years   The dreams that were dreaming   Have time to come true   Cause weve got forever   And forever is meant for so very few   We shall have music   We shal have rhyme   We shall have each other   One minute after the end of time   Then well add up the pleasures   And treasure the sums   Caring is sharing   The cake and the crumbs   How lucky we are to be me and you   Cause weve got forever   And forever is meant for so very few   <Ad lib to fade>
