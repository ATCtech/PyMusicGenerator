We made a fire   Went down in the flames   We sailed the ocean   And drowned in the waves   Built a cathedral   But we never prayed   We had it all yeah   And we walked away   Point of no return and now   Its just too late to turn around   I try to forgive you   But I struggle cause I dont know how   We built it up so high and now Im fallin   Its a long way down   Its a long way down from here   We had a mountain   But took it for granted   We had a spaceship   But we couldnt land it   We found an island   But we got stranded   We had it all   Who couldve planned it?   Point of no return and now   Its just too late to turn around   I try to forgive you   But Im struggling cause I dont know how   We built it up so high and now Im fallin   Its a long way down from here   Such a long way down   Its a long way down   Its a long way down   Such a long way down   Its a long way down   Its a long way down
