My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars   And youre the only one that could take me this far   Ill be forever searching for your love   Oh I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How will I get through this storm?   I cant live another day without your love   At night I pray before I sleep in hopes of finding you   Ive opened up my heart I want you to come through   I close my eyes Im searching for your love   Oh I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How will I get through this storm?   I cant live another day without your love   I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How will I get through this storm?   I cant live another day without your love   Hoo hoo Go on now baby Hoo hoo   I walked away but I was wrong   I cant make it another day   Youre the one that makes me strong   I cant make it another day   Youre the fire that keeps me warm   I cant make it another day   How will I get through this storm?   I cant live another day without your love   Its just too much for me   Its just too much for me   Its just too much for me
