Ah I feel a fountain in my brain   Icecold water runnin through my vein   Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears   Hearts so sad cause loves gone bad   I see a rainbow going black   Must be a sign you aint comin back   Wake up at night callin your name   I see a face on my window pane   Ive been this way since youve been gone   Without your love I cant go on   Look in the mirror what do I see?   A cryin face kinda looks like me   Now wheres the love you promised me?   Wheres the tenderness to comfort me?   Every time some love I choose   I seem to always be the one to lose   Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears   Hearts feeling sad cause loves gone bad   Loves gone bad hearts feeling sad   Black crows flying up above   Its a sign I live my life without love   Slimes on the land slimes on the sea   Slimes not the last thing Im destined to be   In this whole world where theres nothing right   Since youve been gone I cant sleep at night   You said youd be true to me   Instead you made a fool of me   Hearts feeling sad loves gone bad   Loves gone bad hearts feeling sad   Loves gone bad hearts feeling sad   Loves gone bad hearts feeling sad
