Dont try to make me stay 
 Or ask if Im okay 
 I dont have the answer 
 Dont make me stay the night 
 Or ask if Im alright 
 I dont have the answer 
 Heartache doesnt last forever 
 Ill say Im fine 
 Midnight aint no time for laughing 
 When you say goodbye 
 It makes your lips so kissable 
 And your kiss unmissable 
 Your fingertips so touchable 
 And your eyes irresistible 
 Ive tried to ask myself 
 Should I see someone else? 
 I wish I knew the answer 
 But I know if I go now if I leave 
 Then Im on my own tonight 
 Ill never know the answer 
 Midnight doesnt last forever 
 Dark turns to light 
 Heartache flips my world around 
 Im falling down down down 
 Thats why 
 I find your lips so kissable 
 And your kiss unmissable 
 Your fingertips so touchable 
 And your eyes irresistible 
 Irresistible Irresistible 
 Irresistible Irresistible 
 Irresistible Irresistible 
 Irresistible 
 Its in your lips and in your kiss 
 Its in your touch and your fingertips 
 And its in all the things and other things 
 That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible 
 It makes your lips so kissable 
 And your kiss unmissable 
 Your fingertips so touchable 
 And your eyes your eyes your eyes 
 Your eyes your eyes your eyes 
 Irresistible
