 Youre sellin out souls but 
 I care about mine 
 Ive got to get stronger 
 And I wont give up the fight

 Dont it make you wanna scream

 Your bash abusin

 Somebody please have mercy 
 Cause I just cant take it 
 Stop pressurin me

 Make me wanna scream 
 Stop pressurin me 
 Just stop pressurin me 
 Stop pressurin me

 Stop pressurin me 
 Just stop pressurin me

 Keep changin the rules 
 While youre playin the game

 I think I might go insane 
 Now baby 
 With such confusion 
 Dont it make you wanna scream 
 Your bash abusin 
 Victimize with
