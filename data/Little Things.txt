Your hand fits in mine   Like its made just for me   But bear this in mind   It was meant to be   And Im joining up the dots   With the freckles on your cheeks   And it all makes sense to me   I know youve never loved   The crinkles by your eyes   When you smile   Youve never loved   Your stomach or your thighs   The dimples in your back   At the bottom of your spine   But Ill love them endlessly   I wont let these little things   Slip out of my mouth   But if I do   Its you   Oh its you   They add up to   Im in love with you   And all these little things   You cant go to bed   Without a cup of tea   And maybe thats the reason   That you talk in your sleep   And all those conversations   Are the secrets that I keep   Though it makes no sense to me   I know youve never loved the sound of your voice on tape   You never want to know how much weigh   You still have to squeeze into your jeans   But youre perfect to me   I wont let these little things   Slip out of my mouth   But if its true   Its you   Its you   They add up to   Im in love with you   And all these little things   Youll never love yourself   Half as much as I love you   Youll never treat yourself right darlin   But I want you to   If I let you know   Im here for you   Maybe youll love yourself like I love you   Oh   Ive just let these little things   Slip out of my mouth   Cause its you   Oh its you   Its you   They add up to   And Im in love with you   And all these little things   I wont let these little things   Slip out of my mouth   But if its true   Its you   Its you   They add up to   Im in love with you   And all your little things
