The World Ain'T Ready For Me Yet (Prod. by Mart85) 
 Eminem 
 Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased 
 For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place 
 I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides' 
 And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides 
 I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool 
 And chews on human body tissue till its stomach gets full 
 Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool 
 Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool 
 I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold 
 And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold 
 I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold 
 And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed 
 We be hangin' on the block till dawn 
 Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon 
 Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan 
 Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa 
 It's like this and like that and like this (huh-huh) 
 My name is Marshall Mathers (I think that's my name) 
 Cause this is how I am in real life 
 Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa 
 It's like this and like that and like this (ya hear me?) 
 I try to keep it positive and play it cool 
 The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
 Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa 
 I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless 
 Patrolling corners 
 Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
 I'm meaner in action 
 Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer 
 And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
 I grew up in the wild hood 
 As a hazardous youth 
 With a fucked up childhood 
 That I used as an excuse 
 And ain't shit changed 
 But kept the same mindstate 
 Since the third time that I failed 9th grade 
 You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it 
 I don't promote violence I just encourage it 
 I laugh at the sight of death 
 As I fall down a cement flight of steps 
 And land inside a bed of spider webs 
 So throw caution to the wind 
 You and a friend 
 Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again 
 Shit, why not? Blow your brain out 
 I'm blowing mine out 
 Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
