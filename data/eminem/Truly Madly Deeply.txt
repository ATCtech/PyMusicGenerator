Am I asleep am I awake or somewhere in between? 
 I cant believe that you are here and lying next to me 
 Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined 
 Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine? 
 Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss 
 And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this 
 Im just the underdog who finally got the girl 
 And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world 
 Truly madly deeply I am 
 Foolishly completely falling 
 And somehow you kicked all my walls in 
 So baby say youll always keep me 
 Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you 
 In love with you 
 Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed 
 And wake you up with all the words that I still havent said? 
 And tender touches just to show you how I feel 
 Or should I act all cool like it was no big deal? 
 Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this 
 Or put this day back on replay and keep reliving it 
 Cause heres the tragic truth if you dont feel the same 
 My heart would fall apart if someone said your name 
 Truly madly deeply I am 
 Foolishly completely falling 
 And somehow you kicked all my walls in 
 So baby say youll always keep me 
 Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you 
 I hope Im not a casualty 
 Hope you wont get up and leave 
 Might not mean that much to you 
 But to me its everything 
 Everything 
 Truly madly deeply I am 
 Foolishly completely fallen 
 And somehow you kicked all my walls in 
 So baby say youll always keep me 
 Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you 
 In love with you 
 In love with you 
 With you
