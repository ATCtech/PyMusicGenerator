(Skylar Grey and Bruno Mars) 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like a fire that flames and die 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like what we did a while ago 
 Now I love to hate you 
 Now I love to hate you (Dr. Dre) 
 (Eminem) 
 Uh, I just can't get it 
 Pull a 5th of Bacardi from out of my underwear 
 And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head 
 Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead 
 And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed 
 Till I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer 
 Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta 
 I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' die Santa 
 Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders 
 So quit tryin' to play the Wall like you're Paul and 
 Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin' 
 They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin' 
 'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin' 
 Makin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's 
 But I'm not throwin' ones, five, tens or even twenties 
 I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's 
 Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's 
 From the north, east and west but when it comes to them trailers in them Southparks 
 Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's 
 So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outtie 
 Now hop in my mini-van, let's get rowdy, come on 
 Now you can do this on your own 
 But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone 
 So get on the floor and grab somebody 
 (Skylar Grey and Bruno Mars) 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like a fire that flames and die 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like what we did a while ago 
 Now I love to hate you 
 Now I love to hate you 
 (Eminem) 
 Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across 
 Man, even my dentist hates when I floss 
 Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche 
 Garbage bag for one of the windows 
 Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em 
 Michigan plates and my name's on 'em 
 Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him 
 But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him 
 He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him 
 'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man 
 Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can 
 There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance 
 We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance 
 She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man 
 In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call 'em tramp stamps 
 That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps 
 Down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance 
 (Royce da 5'9) 
 Me and Eminem or should we call Marshall had sat with him 
 Kicked it and had a chat with him 
 And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him 
 Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him 
 Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it 
 Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction 
 Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk 
 Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection 
 Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
 But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up 
 Was through that publication the same one that made me famous 
 Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' 
 Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then 
 When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think 
 That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. 
 And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it 
 Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict 
 I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further 
 But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' 
 I'm just willin' to be the bigger man 
 If y'all can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin' 
 'Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' 
 I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause 
 (Skylar Grey and Bruno Mars) 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like a fire that flames and die 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like what we did a while ago 
 Now I love to hate you 
 Now I love to hate you 
 Now I love to hate you, you, you 
 (Eminem) 
 You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up 
 Be a man, stand, a real man would have had this shit handled 
 Know you just had your heart, ripped out and crushed 
 They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust 
 Nah, it ain't like, Doody to do that 
 He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first 
 But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse 
 Now I'm poppin' Vic's, Perc's and Methadone pills 
 Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it, now I hate you 
 (Skylar Grey and Bruno Mars) 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like a fire that flames and die 
 Now it's time for us to let go 
 Like what we did a while ago 
 Now I love to hate you 
 Now I love to hate you 
 Now I love to hate you, you, you (Dr. Dre) 
 Now it's time (time)
