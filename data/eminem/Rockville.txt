All right it's my turn let me show you how I do shit 
 Its nothin' like you guys 'cause I recite poetry that knowone likes 
 This is the night for all of us to flow to everyone and not for fun 
 Come on now I'm on its real and Ima tell you how I feel 
 Everyone of you punk mothafuckas see us as fake 
 That's a big mistake 'cause when your fuckin' with us we can't be stopped 
 Were on top poppin' off right now whilin out 
 Fucking with us you will be dealt with your head cut off 
 Me and my crew aren't soft you will be pissed and I also promise 
 To leave you dismissed along with gettin' your ass kicked 
 Were from the ROCK and where I'm from you can't be seen 
 All of you are the downfall and you don't have the balls to come at us 
 I'm NOTORIOUS like BIGGY and I love when fake niggas test me 
 I came in this game with my pockets empty and left with a roll of 20's 
 There's a first time for every rhyme and every line this is mine 
 My 1 YEAR bid in the bin it made me a man 
 Doing this shit crazy while half of you amaze me 
 If this is nonsense to you its because you ain't been through 
 You obviously ain't been threw shit 
 Age 16 started hating everyone and everything 'cause I relized that 
 Shit doesn't always go my way unless I got money that earns say 
 While the consequences every year come with fear 
 Cause around here you never know when death is near 
 This shit is really how I feel doubt me and it makes me stronger 
 I ts an adrenaline rush when I touch the dutch along with the mic 
 Around here I am well liked so fuck all of you that think I'm shit 
 'Cause if there really is a real nigga I'm it 
 I ain't gonna stop till I know me and my crew are on top 
 Of the charts and ahead of our rap game 
 Maintain by gettin' our words of stress 
 Str8ght to all of your heads so you know we don't play 
 I pray everyday to be like me 'cause I know I'm ready 
 To do this shit that I was not taught to do 
 My mind is my eyes that lye me to be blind 
 Hoping to find my lyrics to make all of you fear this.
