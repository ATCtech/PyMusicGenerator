Now that you cant have me 
 You suddenly want me 
 Now that Im with somebody else 
 You tell me you love me 
 I slept on your doorstep 
 Begging for one chance 
 Now that I finally moved on 
 You say that you missed me all along 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Who do you think I am? 
 You only love to see me breaking 
 You only want me cause Im taken 
 You dont really want my heart 
 No you just like to know you can 
 Still be the one who gets it breaking 
 You only want me when Im taken 
 Youre messing with my head 
 Girl thats what you do best 
 Saying theres nothing you wont do 
 To get me to say yes 
 Youre impossible to resist 
 But I wouldnt bet your heart on it 
 Its like Im finally awake 
 And youre just a beautiful mistake 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Who do you think I am? 
 You only love to see me breaking 
 You only want me cause Im taken 
 You dont really want my heart 
 No you just like to know you can 
 Still be the one who gets it breaking 
 You only want me when Im taken 
 Thank you for showing me 
 Who you are underneath 
 No thank you I dont need 
 Another heartless misery 
 You think Im doing this to make you jealous 
 And I know that you hate to hear this 
 But this is not about you anymore 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Who do you think I am? 
 You only love to see me breaking 
 You only want me cause Im taken 
 You dont really want my heart 
 No you just like to know you can No you dont no you dont 
 Still be the one who gets it breaking Breaking 
 You only want me when Im taken 
 Now that you cant have me 
 You suddenly want me
