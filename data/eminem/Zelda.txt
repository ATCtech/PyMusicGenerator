Back when I was riseing up 
 All the suckers used to play 
 Acting like they all that 
 And no one knew the way 
 To Ganon's castle, Level nine 
 Link had the power, I had the mind 
 I held the magic sword way up high 
 I knew I could win I didn't have to try 
 The NES Advantage was on my side 
 I take evil for a ride 
 I smoke the tactites like they was hooch 
 Cause soon I know I'd have zelda's cootch 
 I'd walk to meet The motherfuckin gannon 
 He'd disappear like a ball from a cannon 
 I raise my voice and I shout out loud 
 I got the triforce and I am proud 
 I finally hit him with the silver arrow 
 And you know I leave the rock 
 Even though the road to good is narrow 
 Zelda's on my jock 
 Cause my balls is big, to be this brave 
 Princess zelda is the one I saved 
 Now I'm playing with power 
 The nineteen eighty's will never go sour 
 Yeah, who would have thunk it, it must have been a drunken 
 Someone who could pump it with a beat so funky 
 Hell yeah bitch, you heard it hear first 
 Recognize now or you're gonna need a nurse 
 To stitch up the wounds from the k and the b 
 Redefine the word "originality", can't fuck with this shit, 1986 
 We was in the mix and zelda was the fuckin' fix 
 Now we bringin' this shit, full fuckin' circle 
 Can't hate with this? go hang with steve erkle 
 'Cause we regulatin hardcore, now you know what's in store 
 Beggin for a little more, glad I was in level 4 
 Realize this, I'm creepin' through the mist 
 With the fuckin' triforce, and I'm motherfuckin pissed 
 Now you realizin this beats hipnotizin, my skill keeps rising 
 All this shit just ties in, step back I got the players guide 
 Fuckin' game genie with the codes inside 
 Skill to save hyrule and the rest of mankind 
 All this shit be stickin in your mind 
 Now you understand the controller in your hand 
 You almost beat the game, but you ain't the fuckin' man 
 So leave it up to me, and back the fuck off 
 You think you're hardcore, but your skill be soft 
 I piss on your cartridge, throw it in the trash 
 Take it to the pawn shop for some cash 
 You don't belong on my NES 
 I grab your controller to show I'm the best
