If I can't shoot you, 
 Ima have to kill you by spittin', 
 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you gettin', 
 We up on the stage you getting all nervous, 
 Ima get rid of you, 
 Now how you like my service, 
 U see me up here, 
 Devil without a purpose, 
 Please step back, 
 And watch me as I work this, 
 If I had a rating, 
 My style would be perfect, 
 'Cause in the rap game, 
 Everything is worth it, 
 Wherever you go, u have to cause a scene, 
 Ur dirty, u should try the washing machine, 
 All ur clothes are all stained up full of cum, 
 That's why you should wash them, 
 Man ur so dumb, man ur so stoopid, 
 Brain fulla looped-shit, 
 U think ur all romantic, u think ur cupid, 
 U think ur hot, u think ur cute shit, 
 But the thing is, ur just a new kid, 
 I got 130 seconds to spit at ur face, 
 Not too fast though, I gotta keep a steady pace, 
 Ill smack ur face way back to last place, 
 U better try hard, this'll be ur last race, 
 The last guy, shit man I licked him, 
 U better watch out, ur my next victim, 
 If I can't shoot you, 
 Ima have to kill you by spittin', 
 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you getting, 
 If I can't shoot you, 
 Ima have to kill you by spittin', 
 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you getting, 
 I'm awesome, I rap with adrenaline, 
 I don't care about this bitch, yeah I'm killin' him, 
 He can't rap worth shit, 
 There's no will in him, 
 Hes eating my words, hope its fillin him, 
 Now listen to wut 
 I instill in him, 
 Fear, 
 I switch gears 
 So fast its killin' him (record scratches) 
 I'm awesome, good on all cylinders, 
 Don't matter if it's a bitch, I'm still killin' her, 
 This bitch can't rap at all, there's no will in her, 
 She's eating my words, hope its fillin her, 
 Now listen to 
 Wut, 
 I instill in her, 
 Fear, 
 I switch gears so fast, 
 Its killin' her, 
 U so skinny, 
 U can hide behind a flagpole, 
 Ur so fat, 
 U could probably eat a fag, whole, 
 U walk around, with ur pants sagged low, 
 Ur lifes over, time to put it in the bag bro, 
 When its ur turn I know ur gonna freeze, 
 All of a sudden, it's a hundred degrees, 
 There's been a forest of chokers, u'll just add to the trees, 
 Feel so bad u'll wish you were overseas, 
 Where's southwest when you really need it, 
 I come wit a warning label, bitch can't you read it, 
 U'll wanna stand up, ill keep you seated, 
 Don't understand? Want me to repeat it, 
 U can't touch me, I'm too hot to handle, 
 U see that, I burned you like a candle, 
 The words gonna spread fast like the Monica Lewinsky scandal, 
 Any word I say, it's the work of a vandal, 
 Man Randle listen to wut I say, 
 U panhandle and ur gay, its ok, 
 Urs shits so gray, 
 Ur words r dead, 
 Maybe itd be better if u'd just shoot urself in the head, 
 Fill ur brain with lead, 
 But don't say I led ur brain to it, 
 Tell 'em you finally thought 'im insane, screw it,' 
 Tell 'em before you did it everybody already knew it 
 Would happen, 
 So dude just stop rappin', 
 When ur on the mic, everybody's laughin', 
 And by the time ur off, everybody's nappin, 
 And when I'm on, everybody's clappin, 
 This shits almost done, I just gotta cap it, 
 This battles a tall fence, u can't hop it, 
 My raps off the wall, u can't top it, 
 So good bye nice try, I'm outta time, 
 I left you behind with a whole mountain to climb 
 If I can't shoot you, 
 Ima have to kill you by spittin', 
 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you getting, 
 If I can't shoot you,

 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you getting, 
 Wit one rhyme I terrorize a mind, 
 Get rid of their ego and carry out a crime, 
 Wit one line I lead one to demise, 
 Bury their lives, 
 And watch them, as they internally cry, 
 Externally die, 
 Leave them eternally scarred, eternally marred, 
 And after it's all over, I send them a card, 
 As soon as I'm up on the stage I'm fulla rage, 
 Like a tiger in his cage, 
 Ready to engage, 
 In a fight, ready to bite, 
 Ready to turn a page, 
 And ready to do it every night, 
 Ready to burn his rage, I'm ready, 
 Just gimme the mic, 
 And watch me strike, 
 My words are like magic, 
 Some endings are tragic, 
 They remember me for years, 
 My lines are classic, 
 U don't wanna battle me, 
 Ur shakin, 
 So go home and bake urself some bacon, 
 I got three breasts under my chest, 
 But I don't understand why I'm under arrest, 
 I'm on a quest, to destroy everything in my way, 
 And if ur with me, than lemme hear you say... 
 If I can't shoot you, 
 Ima have to kill you by spittin', 
 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you getting, 
 If I can't shoot you, 
 Ima have to kill you by spittin', 
 Battlin mothafuckers my ruckus ain't written, 
 When my bullets miss, 
 My words keep hittin, 
 If you like pain, 
 Then that's wut you getting,
