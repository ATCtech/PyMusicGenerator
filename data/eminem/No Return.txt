My heart is telling me to be different 
 Its about time for me to move on 
 Swallow everything, that I learned 
 I'm at a point of no return 
 No return no return no return 
 No return no return no return no return 
 I'm at a point of no return. 
 Man it feels like these walls are closing in, this roof is caving in, 
 Oop its time to raise it then 
 Your days are numbered like pages in my book 
 Of rhymes got 'em cookem boy 
 This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook 
 And scared to look in my eyes, 
 I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I came up from behind 
 And pretty much snuck up and butt f-cked this game up 
 Better be careful when you bring my name up fuck this fame 
 That ain't what I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same 
 On the day that I leave it 
 I swear one way or another I'ma make these f-ckin haters believe it, 
 I swear to god wont spear the rod, I'm a man of my word 
 So your fuckin' heads better nod 
 I'm gonna fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody 
 Sleep on me that pillow is where your head will lie, 
 Permanently bitch it's beddy-bye, 
 This world is my easter egg, yeah, prepare to die' 
 My head is swoll 
 My confidence is up 
 This stage is my pedastal 
 I'm unstoppable the incredible hulk 
 Your trapped in my medicine ball 
 I can run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head will spin dog, 
 I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin' 
 My heart is telling me to be different 
 Its about time for me to move on 
 Swallow everything, that I learned 
 I'm at a point of no return 
 No return no return no return 
 No return no return no return no return 
 I'm at a point of no return. 
 One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain 
 And I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane 
 So they tell me that they love me I know better than that it's just game 
 It's just what comes from fame 
 And I'm ready for that I'm just saying 
 I really can't complain, everything is kosher 
 Two thumbs up, ebert and roeper 
 I really can't see the end getting any closer 
 But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over 
 So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on 
 Can you see me can you see me get your visine on 
 Y'all just do not fit the picture 
 Turn your wide screen on 
 If you thinking I'm gonna quit before I die dream on 
 Man they treat me like a legend 
 Am I really this cold 
 I'm really too young to be feeling this old 
 It's about time you admit it who you kidding man 
 Nobody's ever done it like I did it 
 My heart is telling me to be different 
 Its about time for me to move on 
 Swallow everything, that I learned 
 I'm at a point of no return 
 No return no return no return 
 No return no return no return no return 
 I'm at a point of no return. 
 I'm hot motherfucker, get a plate bitch 
 Don't say shit, get your face lift 
 Rozay bitch let the champagne drip 
 Niggas swag jack, but this l.a. shit 
 Get it back, give it back ain't 'bout shit 
 Snap back them ain't even rare where the tag a what 
 Wack ass all up in my ear bitch bag back

 Got the phantom out, no mats 
 Get your camera out uh, one flash 
 Hot beams steady shot clap your ass 
 Aw, t. raw I'm so uh 
 Loc's on, chucks low, black beanie dog 
 Patron top wash straight from the liquor store 
 I'm turned up I can't feel my face so 
 My heart is telling me to be different 
 Its about time for me to move on 
 Swallow everything, that I learned 
 I'm at a point of no return 
 No return no return no return 
 No return no return no return no return 
 I'm at a point of no return.
