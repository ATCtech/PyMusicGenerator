I keep playing inside my head all that you said to me 
 I lie awake just to convince myself this wasnt just a dream 
 Cause you were right here and I should have taken the chance 
 But I got so scared and I lost the moment again 
 Its all that I can think about oh youre all that I can think about 
 Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind? 
 Im so sorry Im so confused 
 Just tell me am I out of time? 
 Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now? 
 I cant believe I let you walk away when 
 When I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 Every mornin when I leave my house I always look for you 
 I see you every time I close my eyes what am I gonna do? 
 And all my friends say that Im punching over my weight 
 But in your eyes I saw how you were looking at me 
 Its all that I can think about oh youre all that I can think about 
 Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind? 
 Im so sorry Im so confused 
 Just tell me am I out of time? 
 Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now? 
 I cant believe I let you walk away when 
 When I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 When you stood there just a heartbeat away 
 When we were dancing and you look up at me 
 If I had know then that Ive been feeling this way 
 If I could replay I will never let you go 
 No Never let you go 
 Am I out of time? 
 Is your heart taken? Is there somebody else on your mind? 
 Im so sorry Im so confused 
 Just tell me am I out of time? 
 Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now? 
 I cant believe I let you walk away when 
 When I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should I should oh I should have kissed you 
 I should have kissed you
