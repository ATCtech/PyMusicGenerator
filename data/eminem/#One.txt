Back when Andre the giant, mister elephant tusk, 
 Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust. 
 Just one of, my mothers son who got thrown under the bus. 
 Kiss my butt, Lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts. 
 It disgusts, me to see the game the way that it looks. 
 It's a must, I redeem my name 'n' haters get mushed. 
 Bitch-s lust, Man they love me when I lay in the cut. 
 Fist the cut, The lady give her eighty some paper cut. 
 Now picture us, Its ridiculous you curse at the thought, 
 'Cause when I spit the verse the sh-t gets worse then Worcestershure sauce. 
 If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time. 
 Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes. 
 Its elementary, The elephants have entered the room. 
 I venture to say we're the center of attention its true. 
 Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal, 
 Of the bat symbol, The platinum trio's back on you hoes.
