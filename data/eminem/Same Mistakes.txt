Circles we going in circles 
 Dizzys all it makes us 
 We know where it takes us 
 Weve been before 
 Closer maybe looking closer 
 Theres more to discover 
 Find out what went wrong 
 Without blaming each other 
 Think that we got more time 
 When were falling behind 
 Gotta make up our minds 
 So we play play play 
 All the same old games 
 And we wait wait wait 
 For the end to change 
 And we take take take 
 It for granted 
 That well be the same 
 But were making all the 
 Same mistakes 
 Wake up we both need to wake up 
 Maybe if we face up to this 
 We can make it through this 
 Closer maybe well be closer 
 Stronger than we were before yeah 
 Make this something more yeah 
 Think that we got more time 
 When were falling behind 
 Gotta make up our minds 
 So we play play play 
 All the same old games 
 And we wait wait wait 
 For the end to change 
 And we take take take 
 It for granted 
 That well be the same 
 But were making all the 
 Same mistakes 
 Yeah yeah thats what crazy is 
 When its broke and you say 
 Theres nothing to fix 
 And you pray pray pray 
 That everything will be okay 
 While youre making all the 
 Same mistakes 
 Dont look back 
 But if we dont look back 
 Were only learning then 
 How to make all the same mis 
 Same mistakes again 
 So we play play play 
 All the same old games 
 The same mistakes 
 And we wait wait wait 
 For the end to change 
 But nothings gonna change 
 And we take take take 
 It for granted 
 That well be the same 
 But nothings gonna be the same 
 But were making all the 
 Same mistakes 
 Yeah yeah thats what crazy is 
 Crazy is 
 When its broke and you say 
 Theres nothing to fix 
 Theres nothing to fix 
 And you pray pray pray Oh 
 That everything will be okay

 While youre making all the 
 Same mistakes
