Shady Records ain't nobody better than us 
 Shady Records no cheddar than us 
 Shady Records ain't nobody better than us 
 Shady Records 
 I done figured this rap shit out 
 I map shit out strategically 
 Timing is everything and that seems to be the key 
 To my success it's worked for me repeatedly 
 Let them diss you first and respond immediately 
 In order to master the art of war 
 Don't start a war 
 Shit not no more 
 We done scared them off there are no more 
 Victims to sic 
 I'm fixing the pics 
 I'm a start shit 
 I'm out of pictures to rip 
 And shit to throw darts at 
 Ain't got no more targets 
 Shit Irv and Jeff 
 We done beat 'em to death 
 Benzino in debt 
 There seems to just be no one left 
 To bully 
 Bush is pussy 
 Why the fuck you think his name's bush 
 Puss is bushy 
 Ain't shit going on 
 Shit I been getting so bored lately 
 I'm thinking of doing some shit 
 To get you to go and hate me again 
 Tell the truth 
 I liked the shit better then 
 Shit I could spit better 
 I'm about to kick this sick shit again look 
 The game just isn't the same it's changing 
 Shit Dre's quitting 
 Jay's quitting 
 Now it's just wanksta 
 They're saying the same shit 
 It's ancient it's fake 
 It's making me so bored I'ma just make a new language 
 Fubba you cuppa cubba 
 Uppa you Uppa Oobba 
 Youbba can Susubba my dadadabbadick through a tuba 
 Some other rumour lama 
 I'm not a human I'ma 
 Supersonic new robotic suicidal Unabomber 
 You think I'm the new osama 
 Press thinks I'm a new madonna 
 Jeffry Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on a 
 Lot talk and rumours on us 
 Who's the hottest 
 To be honest 
 Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to cuba on us 
 Hey yo 
 Shady Records they ain't better than us 
 Shady Records they ain't getting more cheddar than us 
 Shady Records they ain't better than us 
 Shady Records motherfuckers more cheddar than us
