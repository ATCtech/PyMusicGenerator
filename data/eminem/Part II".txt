 Lloyd Banks! [echoes] 
 Uh huh [echoes] 
 Ha ha! [echoes] 
 (Verse 1 - Eminem) 
 It's like a throne that he don't even own 
 He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around 
 It's like a joke he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing 
 He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry 
 He don't want the fame don't want the lute he's in this for a sport 
 Runnin' suckaz with the competition round the court 
 He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it 
 And you can't love it you can hate it but you can't ignore it 
 You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short 
 But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it 
 And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys 
 And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it 
 (Chorus - Nate Dogg) 
 This Is The Story Of A Warrior you Know you Know It 
 Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise 
 It Ain't Nothin' To Be Makin' Niggaz Paranoid 
 Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapons I Don't Need My Boyz 
 I'm Doin' About 120 On The Fast Lane 
 Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang 
 Don't Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain 
 Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game 
 (Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks) 
 He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate 
 They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate 
 Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate 
 And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate 
 House with just a bigger gate, houndin him was a big mistake 
 He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break 
 'Cause he horrendous when they wouldn't lend a helpin hand 
 So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan 
 Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name 
 When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game 
 And he's ridin' with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them 
 G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin stoppin' them 
 (Chorus - Nate Dogg) 
 This Is The Story Of A Warrior you Know you Know It

 (Verse 3 - 50 Cent) 
 Hes no magician and he gave me somethin' outta nothin' 
 So now niggaz from this hood act like we owe 'em somethin' 
 They talk crazy till we send this nigga through there to buck em 
 Ask 'em if there's a problem and they'll say naw its nothin' 
 He' was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck em 
 He don't care how they feel they makin' 'em love em 
 He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin' 
 He's rich now, he ain't change so Niggaz think he buggin 
 He pull a clip everything these Niggaz try to buck him 
 Keep Two pistols on this hip I show you we ain't tuck em 
 And they say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him 
 Try to catch 'em slippin, they creepin' and he start bustin' 
 (Chorus - Nate Dogg)

 I can give you somethin' you can talk about 
 I can turn this smile upside down 
 You ain't no G-Unit fuckin' clown 
 I can take your girl until I turn her out 
 The bootey laid all out 
 I can give you fuckin' somethin' to be mad about 
 And buy her rings and I back out 
 With my DNA all in her mouth.
