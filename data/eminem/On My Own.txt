Out in the world on my own 
 Don't like to be here by myself 
 Looking for something inside me 
 That will guide me in direction of hope 
 Don't like to be out in the world on my own 
 'Cause I don't wanna live my life like something I don't know 
 Can't find that thing inside of me that will help me grow 
 Can't stand to live... out in the world on my own 
 Feeln sorry for myself 
 'Cause I can't be where I wanna be 
 Left out by myself 
 Hoping and wondering for the perfect day 
 Don't like to be out in the world on my own 
 'Cause I don't wanna live my life like somthin' I don't know 
 Can't find that thing inside of me that will help me grow 
 Can't stand to live out in the world on my own
