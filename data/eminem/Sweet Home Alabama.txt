Future: 
 Well Jimmy moved in with his mother 
 'Cause he ain't got no place to go 
 Eminem: 
 And now I'm right back in the gutter 
 With a garbage bag that's full of clothes 
 Future: 
 'Cause you live at home in a trailer 
 What the hell you gonna do? 
 Eminem: 
 'Cause I live at home in a trailer 
 Mom I'm coming home to you 
 Well my name's Jimmy and his name's Greg Buel 
 And me, him 'n' you went to the same school. 
 This ain't cool, I'm in a rage, he tappin' my mom 
 We're almost the same age. 
 On the microphone I drop bombs 
 Look at this car, thanks a lot moms! 
 "Here, happy birthday, Rabbit, 
 Here's a brand new car, you can have it." 
 A 1928 Delta. This shit won't even get me to the shelter. 
 And I can't even stand for a motel. 
 'Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now. 
 'Cause I live at home in a trailer, 
 Mom I'm comin' home to you...
