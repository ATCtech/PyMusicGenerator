Remember the day we were giving up 
 When you told me I didnt give you enough 
 And all of your friends were saying Id be leaving you 
 Shes lying in bed with my tshirt on 
 Just thinking how I went about it wrong 
 This isnt the stain of a red wine Im bleeding love 
 Please believe me dont you see 
 The things you mean to me? 
 Oh I love you I love you 
 I love I love I love Olivia 
 I live for you I long for you Olivia 
 Ive been idolizing the light in your eyes Olivia 
 I live for you I long for you Olivia 
 Dont let me go 
 Dont let me go 
 Say what youre feeling and say it now 
 Cause I got the feeling youre walking out 
 And time is irrelevant when Ive not been seeing you 
 The consequences are falling now 
 Theres something Im having nightmares about 
 And these are the reasons Im crying out to be with you 
 Please believe me dont you see 
 The things you mean to me? 
 Oh I love you I love you 
 I love I love I love Olivia 
 I live for you I long for you Olivia 
 Ive been idolizing the light in your eyes Olivia 
 I live for you I long for you Olivia 
 Dont let me go 
 Dont let me go 
 When you go and Im alone 
 You live in my imagination 
 The summertime and butterflies 
 All belong to your creation 
 I love you its all I do 
 I love you 
 I live for you I long for you Olivia 
 Ive been idolizing the light in your eyes Olivia 
 I live for you I long for you Olivia 
 Dont let me go 
 Dont let me go 
 Dont let me go
