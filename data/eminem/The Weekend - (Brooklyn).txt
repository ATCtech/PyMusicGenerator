I'm in the zone 
 Don't feel like stayin' home 
 'Cause for now I don't wanna be alone 
 I'm feelin' like it's my day 
 There's no better time to party than a Friday 
 Pick out my clothes call my friends 
 Pop some dro, now let's begin 
 Wentin' out gettin' out not stayin' in the house 
 Call my friends made some plans 
 Findin' out what time the party begins 
 Hangin' out for the weekend 
 Get out the crib have some fun 
 Enjoy yourself live for once 
 'Cause you'll never ever know when your time is up 
 So you got to live it up 
 Now it's about 
 10 o'clock 
 Before I leave I so many other rocks 
 But I'm'a vic you see, so fitted jeans 
 No make up just a little vaseline 
 I'm feelin' fresh, I'm feelin' clean 
 Grab my cds so I can blast it through the streets 
 Pick up my homegirls a cop a touch 
 Get it twisted while we're on the way to the club 
 Live you life 
 With absolutely no regrets 
 No need for contemplating death 
 'Cause you'll look back and miss everything that you have and 
 Party for the night, do what you gotta do 
 If you need some encouragement I ain't even had a chew 
 Do what's right and know that everything will be all right 
 It'll be all right 
 Celebrate life, celebrate hustlin' 
 Pop some mo' for all the money doublin' 
 All my ladies that stick to the rug in this, 
 Smoke some drugs with castle state thuggin' it 
 It's our life we gon' live it up 
 Party all night till we see the sun comin' up 
 Celebrate the weekend 
 Don't forget we gon' celebrate every single day that we breathin'
