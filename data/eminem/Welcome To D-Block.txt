 Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams 
 With things ain't always peachy keen as they seem 
 City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers, 
 Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends 
 The sun don't shine here, in this part of town 
 But we all got a town that's similar to this too 
 'Cause every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood 
 Take a good look around you 'cause there's a D Block near you 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Place where ain't no body that proud, it's a fuckin' black cloud 
 That got people under the impression they can act wild 
 Workin around though, see if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo 
 Five minutes flat the whole town though 
 Lot is assumin a *****s salary 
 More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality 
 Only way you beatin' a body is a technicality 
 Other than that catch 'em and clinton on a gallery 
 The determination and dedication of disipline 
 Listenin and catchin the ***els you was missin' 
 And they still doin' coward shit 
 You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it 
 Somethin' in the air but the older they get, 
 They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick, 
 We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say I'm exquisite, 
 Anytime you can pay us a visit 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams

 Welcome to D Block, the might mighty D Block 
 A place in New York City where Diddy wont even walk 
 Its D Block, the part of Yonkers where I wouldn't be caught 
 Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket 
 D Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walkin', 
 Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op- 
 -Portunity, as soon as you leave out that ***elry shop 
 And you won't even notice your mind will be so preo- 
 -Ccupied on that new watch you just copped 
 You wont even see that ride pull up along side you 
 You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks 
 D Block the place where gees get knocked, locked up 
 Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked 
 You don't even see cops, hiphop police don't even stop, 
 On D Block, where everybody wants to be Pac 
 And you can get popped over the new G Unit reboks 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams

 If you bust and your gun got *****z on the run 
 And you rep where you from ***** you D Block 
 And you try to come home and your pockets is light as a cup 
 They don't give a fuck, you D Block 
 Aiyo bang bang *****z, let's get it on 
 Homies been a monster, but its worst now that my son been born 
 And every ***** where I be, I put in work for free, 
 It's D Block mothafucka, here grab this P 
 (Styles P) 
 Welcome to D Block, a place where lil *****z is killaz, 
 And the mother's raisin a son That turns into Gorillaz, 
 And the hallways is pissy as hell, all we do is get bigger 
 More ignorant, you send us to jail, my *****z shoot anything that'll move 
 Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon, 
 I'd die the way I stand With my man if I can when the shells come, 
 This is D Block y'all welcome 
 (Chorus - Eminem)
