I know you say 
 That you dont like it complicated 
 That we should try keep it simple 
 But love is never ever simple no 
 Someday 
 Youre gonna see the things that I see 
 Youre gonna want the air that I breathe 
 Youre gonna wish you never left me 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 If were never coming back down 
 Yeah were looking down on the clouds 
 I know you say 
 That you dont like it complicated 
 That you are tired of all the changes 
 But love is always always changing woah 
 Someday 
 Youre gonna see the things that I see 
 Youre gonna want air that I breathe 
 Youre gonna wish you never left me 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 If were never coming back down 
 Yeah were looking down on the clouds 
 And we go 
 And we go 
 And we go 
 And we dont stop 
 But we dont 
 No we dont 
 No we dont 
 Never go up 
 And we go 
 And we go 
 And we go 
 And we dont stop 
 But we dont 
 No we dont 
 No we dont 
 Never go up 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end? 
 Here we go again 
 Another go round for all of my friends 
 Another night stop will it ever end?
