Slim mother fuckin' shady... all right 
 Missy elliot, Timbo, c'mon, yo 
 I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends 
 Holdin' a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends 
 Sprayin techs at you 
 Until you see the fuckin' legs full of bullets holes and the exit wounds layin next to you. 
 Fuckin' mad dog, foamin out the mouth 
 Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin out the couch 
 Jumped outta a 93 floor of a buildin 
 And shot every window out on the way to the ground (keep filmin) 
 Woke up to a hospital staff 
 Got up and laughed 
 Chopped 'em in half 
 And sufficated your oxygen mask 
 If I get any higher ima get the east and west beefin again 
 Fly back to detroit and stand in the cross-fire 
 (Ken Kaniff's voice) oh fuck... oh shit 
 I got the hotel room ready 
 What time are you gettin' off... work 
 Or shall I say 
 What time are you comin' over 
 Yo, yo, I'm only smilin' when I'm violent, 
 Got on the plane wylin, 
 Told the piolet to fly me to tylenol Island 
 Stewardess like "you restless?" 
 "No bitch, I'm rest-Full, so hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat this pretzels" 
 Forget school, 
 The other kids are disrespectfull, 
 They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles 
 I can't take it 
 I'm tryin' to gain weight, 
 So I eat steak 
 And swallow the whole plate 
 And weigh myself, naked 
 Without albulms 
 To teach kids family values 
 'Cause every mom and dad should allo you to pop vaiulums 
 And never hit sum 1 unless you got a reason 
 And if there ain't a reason 
 Make 1 up and just start swingin'
