Yeah 
 Ooh ooh 
 Cant believe youre packing your bags 
 Trying so hard not to cry 
 Had the best time and now its the worst time 
 But we have to say goodbye 
 Dont promise that youre gonna write 
 Dont promise that youll call 
 Just promise that you wont forget we had it all 
 Cause you were mine for the summer 
 Now we know its nearly over 
 Feels like snow in September 
 But I always will remember 
 You were my summer love 
 You always will be my summer love 
 Wish that we could be alone now 
 If we could find some place to hide 
 Make the last time just like the first time 
 Push a button and rewind 
 Dont say the word thats on your lips 
 Dont look at me that way 
 Just promise you will remember when the sky is gray 
 Cause you were mine for the summer 
 Now we know its nearly over 
 Feels like snow in September 
 But I always will remember 
 You were my summer love 
 You always will be my summer love 
 So please dont make this any harder 
 We cant take this any farther 
 And I know theres nothing that I wanna change change 
 Cause you were mine for the summer 
 Now we know its nearly over 
 Feels like snow in September 
 But I always will remember 
 You were my summer love Summer love 
 You always will be my summer love Summer love 
 You always will be my summer love 
 You always will be my summer love
