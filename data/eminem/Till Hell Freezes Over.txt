Yo yo yo yo yo (this is) 
 This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop) 
 To hip hop music (anthem) 
 'Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music 
 Until the day that I die (aight bitch) 
 Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ouija boards 
 Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts 
 I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence 
 Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands 
 Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks 
 Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's 
 Jumping off roof tops drunk after I do shots 
 Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts 
 I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks 
 This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops 
 I use to sell pizza's, now I got twelve visa's 
 So tell Jesus I'm gonna quit sinning when hell freezes 
 That's why my brain is out of order 
 That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter 
 But as the world turns and I keep growing older 
 I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over 
 Bitch till hell freezes over 
 I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over 
 And as the world turns and I keep growing older 
 I be living this hip hop till hell freezes... over 
 Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap 
 I think I fucked my head up listing to acid rap 
 I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song 
 And smoke pot till I get high and I stare at shit for too long 
 Like this weed is laced ain't, it taste tainted 
 Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted 
 Spaced out like sci-fi TV 
 Fuck ICP buy my CD 
 Cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut 
 Telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you 
 Ain't no shame in my game I turn the party out 
 Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth 
 That's why my brain is out of order 
 That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter 
 But as the world turns and I keep growing older 
 I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over 
 Bitch till hell freezes over 
 I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over 
 And as the world turns and I keep growing older 
 I be living this hip hop till hell freezes... over 
 Uh, uh uh uh uh 
 Ah ah ah ah
