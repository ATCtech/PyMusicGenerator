(Feat. Xzibit) 
 Eminem: 
 You turn that beat up 
 (Verse 1: Eminem) 
 My music is constantly provin' 
 That it can put you in the mood 
 To jump out of ya car while its movin' 
 You've been waitin' on this moment 
 My sermon is like an omen 
 I'm serving 
 I'm Erick Sermon 
 I saw the window was open and I jumped through it 
 My shit if you don't get pumped to it 
 I quit 
 Heres my rhyme book go ahead and thumb through it 
 And pick what you want from it 
 Rummage 
 And find something you can use to jump someone and roll up of it 
 I'm constantly coppin' over you squattin' 
 Shit has gotten 
 To the point where I ain't even writin' no more I'm just jottin' 
 This is chicken scratch 
 Shit is sickening 
 I've been kickin' ass off of bullshit throw away rhymes 
 Pick a batch 
 I live for the love of rap 
 You crazy? 
 I've made beats for Jay-Z 
 Capri page me 
 If you need a beat 
 You Canibus then its Dre's beat 
 You Kay Slay the beats waved 
 I stay beefin' with JD 
 Till the day Dre two-ways me 
 That its OK to stop blazin' him 
 Ooops I put it out 
 I apoligize now 
 It's too late G 
 Its on tape and the tape leaked 
 Say what you say motherfucker 
 Drama King Kay Slay motherfucker 
 We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker 
 Xzibit lace this little gay midget cock sucker 
 Xzibit: 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 This is dedicated to the man we all love to hate 
 Tattoo a.k.a. The Leprahcaun a.k.a. Mr. Jermaine Dupri 
 Come on ladies and gentlemen sing along 
 Singing: 
 Don't think about no reason 
 Don't think about no reason 
 Don't think about no reason 
 To Liiiiiiive 
 Xzibit: 
 Fuckin' faggot 
 (Verse 2: Xzibit) 
 If ya So So Def then bitch get a hearing aid 
 Ain't worth the gauge 
 Ya heart pumpin' lemonade 
 Hook, line and sink when you took the bait 
 Act ya age not ya size, not ya weight 
 Everytime you profess you makin' hits 
 Why it always got to sound like the next man's shit? 
 Went from Big, to Puff to Snoop to Jay 
 Hey Jermaine whos dick you 'gon ride today 
 Couldn't wait to get the green light from Dr. Dre 
 Never liked ya fuckin' ass any god damn way 
 And I could care less if we label mates 
 I got love for the Brack 
 Get off Bow Wow's back 
 Fuck you, fuck the nigga that's writin' ya raps 
 What up Loc get ya L.A. pass revoked 
 Don't get me wrong Papa Smurf you won't get smoked 
 But you might get robbed and choked 
 Or you might disappear kidnapped with no ransom note 
 Off the leash off the hook off the chain 
 Fuck Jermaine 
 You ain't got to say my name 
 Speak now or forever hold the dick in your mouth 
 You ain't the mayor you don't run shit in the South 
 Scarface run the South motherfucker you a peon 
 The underage bitch in the Kelly tape gettin' pee'd on 
 Cock eyed midget with a Napoleon complex 
 You represent nonsense 
 Harlem Shake to that high jumped to hell 
 You the best in the business I can't tell 
 Too late to apoligize kiss my ass 
 We about to cut your whole Sound Scan in half 
 Homie protect yourself 
 Stop fuckin' with West nigga respect yourself 
 It's a short ride to the top and a long way down 
 Look at the machine I'm about to drop now 
 This ain't no beef 
 Its more like lunch meat 
 Large caliber heat 
 Lets take it to the street 
 Motherfucker 
 Xzibit: 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 Oh my god 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
