Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Come on hit me with my best, 
 Come on hit me with my best 
 Come on hit me with my best 
 Verse 1 [Bizarre]: 
 Proof died, what happened? Marshall stopped rappin' 
 I guess that makes me the captain, hit the matress, pistol packin' 
 Sick assassin, bitch to gassin', get to mashin' 
 D-12 broke up, were you bitches askin' 
 Our clique relaxin' in the hills of Aspen, poppin' pills and Aspirin 
 And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life 
 Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight 
 So I figured that I would grab the mic 
 Like a nig*a 'bout to rhyme right after Christ 
 Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight 
 Grab an oath in the afterlife, that's only right 
 Living like a rock star is the only life 
 And we are, 6 grown men, who are old friends 
 My nig*a Bugz, DeShaun Holton 
 All the way down, I'ma hold them, D-12 nig*a, till the world end 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Come on hit me with my best, 
 Coke on hit me with my best 
 Come on hit me with my best 
 Verse 2 [Swifty]: 
 A lotta nig*as try to underestimate me 
 Till I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea 
 Y'all been placed on a contract for hatin' 
 I'ma waste 'em, one by one, for taintin' 
 Ability to kill a facility, I'm a sinner of Satan 
 Fast as a child rapist facin' 
 Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waitin' 
 They gon' lock me up under the basement 
 I'm a one man army, marine and navy 
 You done made me angry 
 I'm crazy, insane, and maybe 
 I bite the face off your baby 
 For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie 
 I'ma break their Halo 
 Put 'em on the reaper's payroll, erase them and hang their soul 
 It ain't no hoes here, McVay s got a scroll 
 With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Come on hit me with my best, 
 Coke on hit me with my best 
 Come on hit me with my best 
 Verse 3 [Kuniva]: 
 I know you thought we were done, we rose up 
 Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up 
 And hit us with the best shot and we're still standin' 
 So tell the world it can lick our scrotum 
 Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt 
 Who wanna be the fall guy, who want the punt 
 Who wanna get fucked for lookin' at me sideways 
 Every time I roll up I'ma keep it blunt 
 Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall 
 Y'all did it big like Costco 
 And we back in this bitch like a tampon 
 Still fuck dirty, Em's clean like a bar o' soap 
 And you were so slick, on some baffoon shit 
 My hand's on a sweeper, your was on a broomstick 
 Stop lookin' all stupid, I'm rude and abusive 
 And strapped, don't make me use it 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot, 
 Hit me with your best shot, hit me with your best shot. 
 Come on hit me with my best, 
 Coke on hit me with my best 
 Come on hit me with my best 
 Verse 4 [Eminem]: 
 Aight, here's where I come in at... 
 I came in this game with, bad intentions, 
 And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then 
 I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive 
 I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in 
 Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin, 
 So you might wanna button it like Benjamin 
 I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men 
 Step right in this mark with my henchmen and 
 Walk, straight to the stage, 
 I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face 
 Fall back, little cocksucker, I ain't A&W 
 Don't get your cold mugs in my way 
 Get 'em? Shattered, fuckin' A 
 Been this way since B.C., what can I say? 
 I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape 
 Don't get turned to a vegetable dick face 
 You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois 
 D-12 spittin' flames like flamethrowers 
 Spit till we get sprained jaws with metaphors 
 That cut with the same force as chainsaws 
 Hope you're coming with your A game, 
 'Cause things have changed in this game, isn't the same game, boys 
 The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade 
 When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us
