If this room was burning 
 I wouldnt even notice 
 Cause youve been taking up my mind 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 You say its getting late its getting late 
 And you dont know if you could stay if you could stay 
 But you you dont tell the truth 
 No you you like playing games 
 Your hands touching me theyre touching me 
 And your eyes keep saying things 
 Theyre saying what wed do 
 When its only me and you 
 I cant concentrate 
 Thats all Im thinking about 
 All I keep thinking about 
 Everything else just fades away 
 If this room was burning 
 I wouldnt even notice 
 Cause youve been taking up my mind 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 You say youre a good girl 
 But I know you would girl 
 Cause youve been telling me all night 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 Backseat of the cab were in the cab now 
 Or lips getting so attached theyre so attached now 
 You wanna make some rules now 
 Cool then well watch them break tonight 
 I know what you want 
 And Ive been waiting so long 
 If this room was burning 
 I wouldnt even notice 
 Cause youve been taking up my mind 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 You say youre a good girl 
 But I know you would girl 
 Cause youve been telling me all night 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 I know you want it 
 I know you feel it too 
 Lets stop pretending 
 That you dont know and I dont know 
 Just what we came to do 
 If this room was burning 
 I wouldnt even notice 
 Cause youve been taking up my mind 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 You say youre a good girl 
 But I know you would girl 
 Cause youve been telling me all night 
 With your little white lies little white lies 
 With your little white lies little white lies
