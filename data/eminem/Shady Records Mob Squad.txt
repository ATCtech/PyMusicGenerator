Eminem: 
 S-S-Shady Records, you better believe the HYPE is real... 
 'Yeah! Yeah! You rockin' wit the talk of New York Tony yayo Shady aftermath with the Soul Assasins. 
 Niggas know what I'm about out here 
 I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to 
 You can run your own mouth, I don't care 
 If you get too close I'm gon' clap you 
 It's too real out here, to be scared 
 A real nigga gon' do whatever he has to 
 A man is the last thing you should fear 
 It ain't considered a crim unless they catch you 
 We all die 1 day... 
 Obie Trice: 
 Niggas, when I step up in the bar, faggots's wanna look 
 Like you muthafuckas got Obie Trice shook 
 Like I'ma stand here as a man 
 And let some queer-ass funny lookin' nigga get the upper hand 
 I got issues... got no time 
 Got guns than more niggas moms 
 Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas rides 
 Everybody runnin' for they muthafuckin lives 
 Tough Club niggas? we leave early 
 Cock back shirley, open up ya fade 
 Your gray brain needs motor city paid 
 Your nervous system still twitch on days; these 
 Ho's and animals ?'s get merked 
 Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt 
 Don't ever let a nigga tell you 'play the ball hard' 
 Trust in God 'cause you's about to have a bullet scar 
 I give a fuck where you from, who you be with 
 Keep this a secret, right by the nuts 
 A .45 that'll light niggas up 
 And this .45 high make me not give a fuck 
 Lloyd Banks: 
 But as long as I'm here I'm gon' grab checks 
 And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks 
 Poverty'll make ya ass bet 
 My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last bet 
 They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun 
 If that's the case, then get a bigger one 
 You don't think I pack the 'bump' 'cause I'm out the hood 
 That's a stereotype, like everybody that's black can jump 
 I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done 
 Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic and them 
 I'm out in dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from 
 Living lavish I'm established till the cabbage'll come 
 I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on a train 
 I travel first class, you ain't ever got a TV on your plane 
 Ssh, be easy on my name 
 'Cause I ain't goin' bank 'n' forth 
 Your boss and ya captains's soft 
 Eminem: 
 We gon' bring it to anybody who want it 
 You want it? you gon' get it 
 Man when we gon' hit 'em 
 Chew 'em up and spit 'em out 
 <Spit> too much venom 
 And if you roll wit em 
 We gon' fuck you up wit 'em 
 I got too much momentum 
 Movin in my direction to lose 
 My shoes'll explode as soon as you go to step in 'em *BOOM!* 
 You know how we do it when we do how we do it 
 And we come through, g-unit d one two (D12) and Obie we all move 
 Like assassins, ski masks and gloves 
 Consider this as a warning, disaster comes 
 Faster than you can react to it, just ask Marx 
 We are fizzast, fuck your little bitch as up 
 We are not killas, my vato will have you shot though 
 Drag the little body on fuck like kim osario's 
 Little sorry-o ass, go ask B-Real 
 We burn Source coovers like fuckin' Cyrpress Hill 
 Then in the Ninties when you was in diapers still 
 Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real 
 This is no joke, I don't smoke, but I toke 
 Enough second hand to make my fuckin' P.O. choke 
 I'm an O.G. you're fuckin' wit a G.I. Joe 
 BIA BIA, MIA-MIA you livin' la vida a loc? 
 I'm a psyhco, mariah ain't got shit on me 
 When I retire I'll be spittin' baby food on peep- 
 Le it at San Ceedrow Ranch huddled up next to a 'em with hello kitty on slippers on humpin her 
 Legs 
 You ever had your cap peeled back? or your shit pushed in? 
 I'll put my blade in you like a fuckin' pin cushin 
 Slice your ear clear off, Schmirnoff and Hen dawg (hennessy) 
 I'll show you how to fuckin' kill a man like Sin-dog 
 Nobody told you that I'm loco esse? 
 I lack every sane chemical in my membrane 
 I'm Slim Sha... DY and it is for dees nuts 
 And you can get each one for free so feast up 
 I pee in a cup for 3 months, I'm having a E party 
 For easter, please come 
 50 Cent: 
 We gon' bring it to anybody who want it 
 You want it? you gon' get it 
 Your name up over him, chew him up 
 And spit him out <spit noise> 
 Too much venom 
 And if you roll wit' him we gon' fuck you up wit' him 
 You can do all them push ups to pump up ya chest 
 I got a 12 gauge Marksberg to pump up ya chest 
 Have you gaspin for air after that shell hit ya vest 
 Fear me like you fear God 'cause I bring death 
 Silver back gorilla in the concrete jungle 
 I'm the strongest around, you know how I get down 
 I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy 
 Turn it off before it ends because the bad guy dies 
 If you tryin' to buy guns from the nigga that look to 
 So what they got bodies on 'em they still look new 
 You can raise your voice like you finna touch somethin' 
 When I raise my knife, shit I'm finna cut somethin' 
 They say I walk like Ron O'neil and talk like obie (obie trice) 
 If the bitch think I love her, well then the bitch don't know me 
 Haha, sorry KIM (eminem's ex wife)
