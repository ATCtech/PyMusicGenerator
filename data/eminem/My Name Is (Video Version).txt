 (Ahem. Excuse me! Can I have the attention of the class for one second?) 
 Hi, kids! Do you like Primus? ( 
 yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 ) 
 Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? ( 
 uh-huh! 
 ) 
 Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? ( 
 yeah, yeah! 
 ) 
 Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? ( 
 huh? 
 ) 
 My brain's dead weight; I'm tryin' to get my head straight 
 But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate ( 
 umm... 
 ) 
 And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead!" 
 Uh-uh! "Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted!" 
 Well, since age twelve, I've felt like a caged elf 
 Who stayed to himself, in one space, chasing himself ( 
 bladabladablada 
 ) 
 Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off 
 And smacked her so hard, I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross 
 I'm 'bout to pass out and crash and fall in the grass 
 Faster than a fat man who sat down too fast 
 C'mere, lady! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!) 
 I don't give a damn; Dre sent me to tick the world off!

 My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high 
 Thanks a lot. Next semester I'll be thiry-five 
 I smacked him in his face with an eraser 
 Chased him with a stapler, and told him to change the grade on the paper ( 
 now 
 ) 
 Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up 
 Served the bartender and walked out with a tip cup 
 Extra-terrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship 
 While they're screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends!" 
 Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to 
 I just found out, my mom does more (---) than I do 
 I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper 
 Make a record about doin' (---) and name it after her ( 
 hey, mom 
 ) 
 You know you blew up when the women rush the stands 
 And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans ( 
 ah! ah! 
 ) 
 This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?) 
 So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, (---)!"

 Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away ( 
 get him! 
 ) 
 Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate 
 I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die 
 I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive 
 Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide 
 I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid, (---)? ( 
 go ahead 
 ) 
 All my life I was very deprived 
 I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide ( 
 whoops! 
 ) 
 Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk ( 
 hah-too 
 ) 
 I spit when I talk, I'll (---) anything that walks ( 
 c'mere 
 ) 
 When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits 
 How ya gonna breastfeed me, mom?! You ain't got no (---)! ( 
 waah, wah! 
 ) 
 I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
 Put a bulletproof vest on and tap myself in the head ( 
 bang! 
 ) 
 I'm steamin' mad, ( 
 arrrh! 
 ) and by the way when you see my dad ( 
 yeah? 
 ) 
 Ask him if he bought a porno mag and see my ad
