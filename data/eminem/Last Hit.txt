"Shady!" 
 "That's me" 
 "Iron Mic Trilogy" 
 "Back, with the fliest material" 
 "Sh, Sh, Shady!" 
 "That, that, that's me" 
 "Iron Mic Trilogy" 
 "Back with the, funky, beats" 
 Packing the third eye rush you it's cyclopes 
 They trade in their high tops for night sized white rocks 
 Words in my right, they pass my left ear 
 It's solid decked out write the books for next year 
 Bear this grenade you got stuck like virgin 
 Who that cat splurgin' instead or rehearsin' 
 Tough guy, DJ Travi your high rise 
 Looking more like Ronald then the fuckin' fry guys 
 Go on uptown fucking senoritas 
 In Taco Bell screaming "vivas gorditas!" 
 Bring all your dogs I give 'em rabies 
 They never had a chance I might chew up all their babies 
 Pope John Paul the second, brain like Satan 
 Have your vegan girlfriend cooking up bacon 
 I'm obituite with that shit that you hit 
 Slow my flick with ya cause mine to pick wit her 
 My nine is limpin' ya six deep when I spray rounds 
 Hit you with twelve shots in mid air and four more on the way down 
 The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground 
 You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!) 
 No pun intended, snapped out of your whip 
 And leave it un-attended before I whip out this gun and hit it 
 Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute 
 'Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it 
 Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it 
 You wanted a market, I got her tied up in a chair and gag 
 Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged 
 Like cave-women, while I'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Man 
 If you got a bowl of hash better cash it 
 Dollar signs flashin' I'ma take the last hit 
 And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone 
 I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it 
 If you got a bowl of hash better cash it 
 Dollar signs flashin' I'ma take the last hit 
 I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid 
 Threw my baby's mother in a nap sack and latched it 
 Yo, "Eon's whack now", how you dig that? 
 Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap 
 Get the greater rate with these rhymes I be totin' 
 Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem 
 I got stupid mucus from these loose lips 
 My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak 
 To the point when you stand up on your feet {you} best retreat 
 Let's go back in time and steal my whole seed 
 The quickening, did a briss at the christening 
 I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage 
 This thing's the nicest, I keep telling you 
 What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you? 
 I'm e-mailing you, at the wrong website 
 Misspelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you 
 Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse 
 Disperse like I added too many words in a verse 
 Slim Shady, a perverted virgin at birth {or "version of birth"} 
 Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church 
 The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker 
 That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first 
 You don't curse and hit with your own words 
 Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves 
 And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up 
 Then I'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all!) 
 If y'all got a bowl of hash better cash it 
 Dollar signs flashin' I'ma take the last hit ("gimmie that") 
 And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone 
 I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it 
 So if you got a bowl of has better cash it 
 Dollar signs flashin' I'ma take the last hit 
 I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid 
 Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it 
 Any disease out there I'm willing to catch it, 
 Slim Shady 
 All praises 
 To the High and Mighty
