 Eminem as Ramus: 
 Dear Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, I wrote but you still aren't calling 
 I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom 
 I sent two letters back in autumn; you must not-a got 'em 
 There probably was a problem at the post office or something 
 Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em 
 But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter? 
 My girlfriend's pregnant too; I'm bout to be a father 
 If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her? 
 I'm a name her Bonnie. I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry 
 I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him 
 I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan 
 I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam 
 I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man 
 I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was fat 
 Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat 
 Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Ramus

 Eminem as Ramus: 
 Dear Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, you still isn't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance 
 I isn't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans 
 If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert 
 You didn't have to, but you could a signed an autograph for Matthew 
 That's my little brother man; he's only six years old 
 We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No." 
 That's pretty shitty man - you're like his ducking idol 
 He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do 
 I isn't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to 
 Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you 
 You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way I never knew my father neither; 
 He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her 
 I can relate to what you're saying in your songs 
 So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on 
 Because I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed 
 I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest 
 Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds 
 It's like adrenaline; the pain is such a sudden rush for me 
 See everything you say is real, and I respect you because you tell it 
 My girlfriend's jealous because I talk about you 24/7 
 But she don't know you like I know you Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, no one does 
 She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up 
 You got to call me man; I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose 
 Sincerely yours, Ramus -- P.S. We should be together too

 Eminem as Ramus: 
 Dear, you know it is a thrill when you go down hill 
 Beause you're riding on a mountain of your own free will 
 And you're zipping in a flash on a daring dash 
 Down a waterfall so rapid that you go splish splash 
 So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it 
 I'm in the car right now; I'm doing 90 on the freeway 
 Hey Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? 
 You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night" 
 About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning 
 But didn't, then Phil saw it all, and then at a show he found him? 
 That's kind of how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning 
 Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy 
 And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call 
 I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall 
 I love you Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, we could a been together, think about it 
 You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it 
 And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it 
 I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me 
 See Zip-a-dee-doo-dah; Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk! 
 Hey Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk 
 But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I isn't like you 
 Because if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too 
 Well, got to go, I'm almost at the bridge now 
 Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? 
 Zip zip zip zip zip zip 
 Zip zip zip zip zip zip zip

 Zip zip-a zip-a-dee-doo-dah-day

 Eminem as himself: 
 Dear Ramus, I meant to write you sooner but me just been busy 
 You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? 
 Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that 
 And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap 
 I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must a missed you 
 Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to disc you 
 But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? 
 I say that shit just clowning dog, c'mon - how fucked up is you? 
 You got some issues Ramus; I think you need some counseling 
 To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some 
 And what's this shit about us meant to be together? 
 That type of she'll make me not want us to meet each other 
 I really think you and your girlfriend need each other 
 Or maybe you just need to treat her better 
 I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time 
 Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine 
 If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Ramus, 
 Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan 
 I just don't want you to do some crazy shit 
 I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick 
 Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge 
 And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid 
 And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to 
 Come to think about, his name was... it was you 
 Damn! 
 Disneyland Fun Chorus: 
 Wonderful feeling, oh what a wonderful day 
 Oh what a wonderful, oh what a wonderful day!
