I thought I saw a girl brought to life 
 She was warm she came around she was dignified 
 Showed me what it was to cry 
 You couldnt be that girl I adored 
 You dont seem to know or seem to care what your heart is for 
 But I dont know her anymore 
 Theres nothing left I used to cry 
 My conversation has run dry 
 Thats whats going on 
 Nothings fine Im torn 
 Im all out of faith 
 This is how I feel 
 Im cold and I am shamed 
 Lying naked on the floor 
 Illusion never changed 
 Into something real 
 Im wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn 
 Youre a little late 
 Im already torn Im already torn 
 Theres nothing left 
 I used to cry 
 Inspiration has run dry 
 Thats whats going on 
 Nothings fine Im torn 
 Nothings fine Im torn 
 Im all out of faith 
 This is how I feel 
 Im cold and I am shamed 
 Lying broken on the floor 
 Illusion never changed 
 Into something real 
 Im wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn 
 Youre a little late 
 Im already torn Im already Im already torn 
 Torn 
 Oh torn
