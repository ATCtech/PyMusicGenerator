Ok, I'm going to attempt to drown myself. 
 You can try this at home, 
 You can be just like me. 
 Slim Shady, brain dead like Jan Brady 
 I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady 
 I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer 
 Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer 
 You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from 
 You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album 
 Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open 
 I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then 
 My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic 
 I have a disease and they don't know what to call it 
 Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash 
 Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass 
 Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin 
 You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 
 The +Proof+ is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton 
 I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman 
 Something's not right 
 I'm sorry, 
 I'm mentally retarded 
 Slim Shady 
 I think that's my name 
 This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out 
 'Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?) 
 Climped out of a nice house, 
 Through the front window and heard this guy shout 
 "Hey that's my couch, bitch!" 
 Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout 
 While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds 
 And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin vertical 
 Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down 
 You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape 
 I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved 
 And Sway and Tech, two disk jokeys 
 Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject 
 Something's not right 
 I'm sorry, 
 I'm mentally retarded 
 Slim Shady 
 I think that's my name 
 I'm ice grillin you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin 
 I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym 
 I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias 
 To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens 
 A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium 
 Than a maniac Saudi Arabian 
 A highly combustible head, spazmatic 
 Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed 
 Laid up in the hospital in critical condition 
 I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician 
 High speed, IV full of thai weed 
 Lookin' Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese 
 Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians 
 Uh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins 
 I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends 
 On if I keep on killin' my girlfriends 
 Something's not right 
 I'm sorry, 
 I'm mentally retarded 
 Slim Shady 
 I think that's my name 
 Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust 
 And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed 
 (Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say 
 I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play 
 I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day 
 Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH) 
 Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin 
 Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine 
 Scratched my balls till I shredded skin 
 "Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been" 
 "It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then 
 I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows 
 That don't even make sense, like dykes usin' dildos
