Eminem - Life 
 Life, by Marshall Mathers, 
 What is life? 
 Life is like a big obstacle, in front of your optic wanna slow you down, 
 An every time you think you've gotten past it it's gonna come back, 
 Around and tackle you to the damn ground, 
 What are friends, friends are people that you think are friends, 
 But they really your enemies with secret identities, 
 And disguises to hide they' true colours, so just when you think you close enough to be brothers, 
 They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin', 
 What is money, money is what makes a man act funny, 
 Money is the root of all evil, 
 Money'll make them same friends come back around, 
 Swearin that they was always always down, 
 But it's life... I'm tired of life, I'm tired of backstabbin' ass snakes with friendly grins, 
 I'm tried of committin so many sins, 
 Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of hennie wins, 
 Tired of never havin' any ends 
 Tired of havin' skinny friends so full on crack and many things, 
 I'm tired of this DJ, playin' your shit when he spins, 
 I'm tired of not havin' a deal, tired of havin' to deal with this bullshit without grabbin the steel, 
 Tired of drowin in my sorrow, 
 Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo, 
 I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin shit an dartin off, 
 I'm tired of jobs startin off at $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin off, 
 Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough, 
 Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breatin down my neck, 
 Drivin' me beserk, 
 I'm tired of using plastic silverwear 
 Tired of workin at buildin square, 
 Tired of not being a millionare, 
 But if I had a million dollars I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alchoholics, 
 If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on, 
 While I'm on the jon, 
 If I had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbin armoured trucks, 
 If I had one wish, I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss, 
 I'm tired of being white trash, broke an always poor, 
 Tired of taken pop bottles back to the party store, 
 Tired of not havin' a phone, tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on, 
 Tired of not drivin' a BM, tired of not workin at GM, tired of wantin to be him, 
 Tired of not sleepin' without atylanol PM, 
 Tired of not performin in a packed collessium, 
 Tired of not bein on tour, 
 Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore, 
 After work in the back of a contour, 
 I'm tired of fakin knots with a stack of ones, havin' a lack of funds, an resort back to guns, 
 Tired of bein stared at, tired of wearin the same damn nike air-hat, 
 Tired of steppin in clubs wearin the same pair of luggs, 
 Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin me rappin' bout drugs, 
 Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me sayin' they wasn't feelin' me or no-bodies as ill as me, 
 And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs tired of J.L.B. sayin' we're hip hop lib's, 
 But if I had a million dollars I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alchoholics, 
 If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on, 
 While I'm on the john, 
 If I had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbin armoured trucks, 
 If I had one wish, I would ask for one big enough ass for the whole world to kiss, 
 You know what I'm sayin'? I'm tired of all of this bullshit, 
 Tellin' me to be positive, how am I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive, 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 I rapp about shit around me, shit I see, 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 And right now I'm tired of everything, 
 Tired of all this, player hating that's going on in my own city, 
 You can't get away or play, 
 You know what I'm sayin', 
 But hey, it's cool though, 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 I'm just fed up, that's my world
