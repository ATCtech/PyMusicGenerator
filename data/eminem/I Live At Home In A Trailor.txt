Well Jimmy moved in with his mother 
 'Cause he ain't got no place to go 
 And now I'm right back in the gutter 
 With a garbage bag that's full of clothes 
 'Cause 
 You live at home in a trailor 
 What the hell you gonna do? 
 Yee haw 
 'Cause 
 I live at home in a trailor 
 Mom I'm coming home for you 
 Break it down 
 Well my name is Jimmy 
 His name is Greg Beau 
 Me him and you we went to the same school 
 This ain't cool 
 I'm in a race 
 He's tappin' my mom 
 We're almost the same age 
 On the microphone I drop bombs 
 Look at this car 
 Thanks a lot mom 
 Here Happy Birthday Rabbit 
 Here's a brand new car 
 You can have it 
 A 1928 Delta 
 This shit wont even get me to the shelter 
 'Cause 
 You live at home in a trailor 
 What the hell you gonna do? 
 'Cause 
 I live at home in a trailor 
 Mom I'm coming home for you
