(Eminem) 
 I really liked you 
 And you didn't listen 
 And now I wanan take back everything I said 
 I wish I were dead 
 To many things that I did 
 To many wrongs that I've done 
 How could I be so stupid 
 Not thinkin' of anyone else 
 Just thinkin' about me 
 If you think a while 
 You will fine out that no one in this world of ours 
 Is perfect 
 (Eminem) 
 I shoulda been thinkin' about the others around me 
 Who I would be hurtin' 
 Who I made mad 
 Who I made sad 
 I just wish I could take it all back 
 Even at the cost of my lyrics 
 Can't bare it 
 I need you 
 I'm nothing without you 
 I'm scared of life 
 I need someone by my side 
 I don't wanna just sit and hide 
 If you think a while 
 You will fine out that no one in this world of ours 
 Is perfect 
 I'm tired of life 
 And its bad ride 
 Everyone that's died in Iraq 
 When the United States were under attack 
 All the terorism goin' on 
 Everyone that been hit by a bomb 
 If you think a while 
 You will fine out that no one in this world of ours 
 Is perfect.
