Written in these walls are the stories that I cant explain 
 I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days 
 She told me in the morning she dont feel the same about us in her bones 
 It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone 
 And Ill be gone gone tonight 
 The ground beneath my feet is open wide 
 The way that Ive been holdin on too tight 
 With nothing in between 
 The story of my life I take her home 
 I drive all night to keep her warm and time 
 Is frozen the story of the story of 
 The story of my life I give her hope 
 I spend her love until shes broke inside 
 The story of my life the story of the story of 
 Written on these walls are the colours that I cant change 
 Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage 
 I know that in the morning Ill see us in the light upon the hill 
 Although I am broken my heart is untamed still 
 And Ill be gone gone tonight 
 The fire beneath my feet is burning bright 
 The way that Ive been holdin on so tight 
 With nothing in between 
 The story of my life I take her home 
 I drive all night to keep her warm and time 
 Is frozen the story of the story of 
 The story of my life I give her hope 
 I spend her love until shes broke inside 
 The story of my life the story of the story of 
 And Ive been waiting for this time to come around 
 But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds 
 The story of my life I take her home 
 I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen 
 The story of my life I give her hope Give her hope 
 I spend her love until shes broke inside Until shes broke inside 
 The story of my life the story of the story of 
 The story of my life 
 The story of my life the story of the story of 
 The story of my life
