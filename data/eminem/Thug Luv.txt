Yo I keep m luv snug bruv 
 But I'm white, so I don't know no thug luv 
 But what you do find is thugs luv then 2time 
 It's a truecrime but most do it 
 Like should I or should'nt I arrr screw it 
 Then when she finds out your cheating 
 She gives you a raw beating for leaving 
 And not luvin 
 Then shit gets heated hotter than a hot oven 
 'Cause you've broken bonds 
 Kissed others with open tongs 
 Being disloyal 
 Like what's been planted in this soil 
 But this is all I've herd 
 How they cheat and end up dead from their bird 
 So if you blare a word of cheating 
 You havent put one foot in 
 You've stook both feet in 
 Then you start watching your back from day one 
 Like you got your clothes the wrong way on 
 But as I say 
 I don't know no thug luv and I'm not one like goldie (ahah) 
 So were did I get this shit from? 
 A little birbie told me
