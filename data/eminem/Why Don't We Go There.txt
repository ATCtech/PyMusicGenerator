I know you want know you want to take it slow 
 But think about all the places we could go 
 If you give in tonight 
 Just let me set you free 
 Well touch the other side 
 Just give me the key 
 Cause we got all night 
 Were going nowhere 
 Why dont you stay? 
 Why dont we go there? 
 Lets take a ride 
 Out in the cold air 
 I know the way 
 Why dont you go there with me? 
 Say the word say the word 
 But dont say no 
 Sky dive you and I with just these clothes 
 Your secrets safe with me 
 Theres no right time or place 
 Cause anyone could see 
 Wed do it anyway 
 Cause we got all night 
 Were going nowhere 
 Why dont you stay? 
 Why dont we go there? 
 Lets take a ride 
 Out in the cold air 
 I know the way 
 Why dont you go there with me? 
 Hey I dont want you be the one that got away 
 I wanna get addicted to you yeah 
 Youre rushing through my mind 
 I wanna feel the high 
 I wanna be addicted 
 Dont say noooo 
 Just let gooooo 
 Cause we got all night 
 Were going nowhere 
 Why dont you stay? 
 Why dont we go there? 
 Lets take a ride Lets take a ride 
 Out in the cold air 
 I know the way I know the way 
 Why dont you go there with me? 
 With me with me
