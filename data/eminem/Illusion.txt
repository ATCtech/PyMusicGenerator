Tell me you believe in love 
 Its not an illusion 
 Ive been thinking about the nights and the dangerous tricks 
 People play on the eyes of the innocent 
 I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke 
 And mirrors disappearing right in front of them 
 But believe me Im not trying to deceive you 
 I promise falling for me wont be a mistake 
 No baby this is not an illusion 
 Ive really got my heart out on my sleeve 
 Oh baby this is not an illusion 
 Theres magic between you and me 
 No baby this is not an illusion 
 You really got me lifted off my feet 
 So tell me you believe in love 
 Cause its not an illusion to me 
 You dont ever have to worry about me about how the cards fall 
 Im all that you need tonight 
 I would never turn your heart into broken parts 
 You dont have to think twice looking in my eyes 
 Cant you see it? 
 Im not trying to mislead ya 
 I promise falling for me wont be a mistake 
 No baby this is not an illusion 
 Ive really got my heart out on my sleeve 
 Oh baby this is not an illusion 
 Theres magic between you and me 
 No baby this is not an illusion 
 You really got me lifted off my feet 
 So tell me you believe in love 
 Cause its not an illusion to me 
 You can tie me up in chains 
 You can throw away the key 
 But theres no trap doors 
 Im not gonna leave 
 Youre the truth I cant explain 
 Youre the only one I see 
 Its not an illusion to me 
 No baby this is not an illusion 
 Ive really got my heart out on my sleeve 
 Oh baby this is not an illusion 
 Theres magic between you and me 
 No baby this is not an illusion 
 You really got me lifted off my feet 
 So tell me you believe in love 
 Cause its not an illusion to me 
 So tell me you believe in love 
 Cause its not an illusion
