When I'm Gone 
 (D-Boi and New Shady Version) 
 D-Boi featuring New Shady and EMINEM 
 (Intro-D-Boi and New Shady) 
 Yo this is D-Boi and this song goes out to Ash 
 I hope you still know I'll pay you a lot of cash 
 (New Shady) 
 Yo and this song also goes 
 Out to my girl- Ashley 
 (Verse 1-D-Boi) 
 Have you ever felt for someone like you don't wanna leave em? 
 But you have to go cause you don't wanna hurt em 
 Cause people are tryin' to hurt you 
 You can't risk them hurtin' her too 
 You pack up and try to leave but hesitate 
 You know you gotta leave the fuckin' state 
 All cause a girl turned your ass down 
 You know you've gotta leave the fuckin' town 
 Then about a mile down the road you think 
 You can't go down wit your ship, you can't fuckin' sink 
 When you get home, your gun's on the ground you pick it up 
 You slip in a pool of blood and you can't get up 
 You think it's over, you think it's all your fault 
 Then you look up and see her picture on the wall 
 You get up and think this the last show, better show it all 
 That's D-Boi, yeah baby D-Boi's crazy 
 New Shady made me, but tonight D-Boi is rock-a-bye baby 
 (Chorus 2x-EMINEM and D-Boi) 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn, 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' 
 And we didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back 
 (Verse 2-D-Boi) 
 You're drivin' down the road and you don't know where your goin' 
 You blacked out after that 40 ounces was fuckin' gone 
 But next thing you know, you wake up in cuffs 
 You look over and there's another pool of blood 
 You think to yourself, I actually did it 
 I killed a man for my fuckin' kid 
 Thank God I did 
 I couldn't take the shit 
 1 year later I wake up in prison 
 They tell me I'm out, 
 Thank your fuckin' spouse 
 I look up and I'm like holy shit 
 I'm married and didn't even know it 
 And then I am at a concert singin' with EMINEM and New Shady 
 And I tell them that Mary Beth's the person I wished was my lady 
 And then I look up and see you Mary Beth up in the crowd 
 I call out her name, but she doesn't hear a sound 
 It's because these damn people are screamin' so loud 
 I say up in my mind I'll always love, care, and treat you good lil sis 
 And that's a promise 
 You're grown up and married to Chris 
 And just as I walk out the jail cell it turns to a stage they're gone 
 And the spotlight is on and EMINEM and me are singin' 
 (Chorus 2x-EMIENM and D-Boi) 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn, 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' 
 And I didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back 
 (Verse 3-New Shady) 
 (D-Boi- yo give it up for yo boy New Shady) 
 I was in prison for someone I shot 
 Up in a parkin' lot 
 But I'm still here 
 I have two more years 
 Until I get released 
 Caught by the police 
 I love my wife, why would I hate her 
 2 more years later 
 I'm out of prison 
 Was it a dream or all a vision 
 I call out to Ashley and she say's yes dear 
 I tell the kids and her to come over here 
 And then I tell her we're goin' for a ride 
 As long as we got each other by our a side 
 We'll be fine 
 And Ashley and me are out wit the kids 
 Ashley turns to me and walks up to me 
 And kisses me on the lips 
 This is the happiest day that I've ever had 
 D-Boi got released yesterday from prison and it made me mad 
 If something were to happen to Ashley or my kids I'd be there to protect 'em like a husband and a dad 
 (Chorus 2x-EMINEM and New Shady) 
 And when we're gone, just carry on don't mourn, 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of our voices 
 Just know that we're lookin' down on you smilin' 
 And we didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back 
 (Verse 4-EMINEM, D-Boi, and New Shady) 
 (All) 
 Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat, 
 The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at our feet, 
 We take a bow and, "thank you all for comin' out", 
 They're screamin' so loud, we take one last look at the crowd 
 (D-Boi) 
 I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein', 
 Daddy it's me! Help mommy her wrists are bleedin'! 
 But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?! 
 I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' 
 You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad, 
 And I bought you this coin, 
 It says "number 1 dad", that's all I wanted 
 I just wanna give you this coin, 
 I get the point, fine, me and mommy are going" 
 (New Shady) 
 But baby wait- 
 It's too late dad, you made your choice. Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us 
 That's what they want 
 They want you Marshall, they keep 
 Screamin your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep. 
 Just take another, pill, yeah I bet ya you will 
 You rap about it. Yeah word, can't keep it real 
 I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see 
 How could it be that the curtain is closing on me 
 I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it, 
 Put it to my brain, scream die Shady!' and pop it 
 The sky darkens, my life flashes, 
 The plane that we were supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes 
 (Eminem) 
 That's when we all wake up, alarm clock's ringin', 
 There's birds singin', it's spring and 
 Hailie's out side swingin', 
 I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her 
 Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say- 
 (Chorus 2x- D-Boi, New Shady, and EMINEM) 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn, 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin' 
 And I didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back
