Making little conversation 
 So long Ive been waiting 
 To let go of myself and feel alive 
 So many nights Ive thought it over 
 Told myself I kinda liked her 
 But there was something missing in her eyes 
 I was stumbling looking in the dark 
 With an empty heart 
 But you say you feel the same 
 Could we ever be enough? 
 Baby we could be enough 
 And its alright 
 Calling out for somebody to hold tonight 
 When youre lost Ill find the way and Ill be your light 
 Youll never feel like youre alone 
 Ill make this feel like home 
 So hard that I couldnt take it 
 Wanna wake up and see your face 
 And remember how good it was being here last night 
 Still high with a little feeling 
 I see the smile as it starts to creep in 
 It was there I saw it in your eyes 
 I was stumbling looking in the dark 
 With an empty heart 
 But you say you feel the same 
 Could we ever be enough? 
 Baby we could be enough 
 And its alright 
 Calling out for somebody to hold tonight 
 When youre lost Ill find the way and Ill be your light 
 Youll never feel like youre alone 
 Ill make this feel like home 
 Ill make this feel like home 
 Baby we could be enough 
 And its alright 
 Calling out for somebody to hold tonight 
 When youre lost Ill find the way and Ill be your light 
 Youll never feel like youre alone 
 Ill make this feel like home
