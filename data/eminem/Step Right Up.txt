Step right up 
 Am about ta light up the sky line 
 So bright am gonna 
 Fuck ya whole night up 
 Light up ya glow sticks 
 And go stick the stick

 This is the host ya surpose 
 To kiss his ass

 If you don't you can go 
 And stick ya whole frickin nose

 And along as it anit a rasict tape 
 From 88 then am straight up 
 That can not be forgave 
 If a drank pee for 18 years straight 
 And eat shit everyday with? porksmen? plate 
 That was shape like a toliet with a fork 'n' steak knife 
 For the rest of my life I had to watch my Ex-wife 
 Get fucked by vanilla ice twice a day 
 'Cause I said. I GDA when I was a teenager
