Lotto: 
 Yo its time to get rid of this coward right here once and for all 
 I'm sick of this mother fucker check this shit out 
 Hah hem yo 
 I'll spit a racial slur honkey, sue me 
 This shit is a horror flick but the black guy doesn't die in this movie 
 Your doing lotto dogg you gotta be kidding 
 That makes me believe you really don't have a interest in living 
 You think these nigga's gonna feel with the shit you say? 
 I got a better chance joining the KKK 
 Off some real shit though I like you 
 That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to 
 Fuck lotto call me your leader 
 I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from leave it to beaver 
 I used to like that show 
 Now you got me in fight back mode, but oh well if you got to go, you got to go 
 I hate to do this I would love for this shit to last 
 So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass 
 All's well that end's ok 
 So I'll end this shit with a fuck you but have a nice day 
 Eminem freestyle: 
 Ward, I think you were a little hard on the beaver 
 So was Eddie Haskell, Wally and Miss Cleaver 
 This guy keeps screaming he's paranoid 
 Quick someone get his ass another steroid 
 Blah be do blah blah do be blu blah 
 I ain't hear a word you say Hibbidy who blah 
 Is that a tanktop or a new bra? 
 Look snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boob job 
 Didn't you listen to the last round meathead? 
 Pay attention your saying the same shit that he said 
 (I'm a fuck you up) 
 Matter of fact dogg here's a pencil 
 Go home write some shit make it suspenseful 
 And don't come back until something dope hits you 
 Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you 
 Lookin' like a cyclone hit you 
 Tanktop screaming "Lotto I don't fit you!" 
 You see how far them white jokes get you 
 Boy's like "how vanilla ice gonna diss you?" 
 My motto fuck lotto 
 I'll get the 7 digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow
