(Woo woo shady shady) 
 Aftermath 
 (Look at that bitch) 
 There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor, bumpin and grindin that pole 
 The way she's grindin that pole, I think I'm losing control 
 Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up 
 Hit the stripclub, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, 
 Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faced 
 Pasted, plastered, puke drink up, get a new drink through the bathroom sink door 
 Wipe your suit clean, got a routine going, still got a few drunks, someone's snooz (?) drinks showin, 
 I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated, I was revived as soon as this bitchz girated (?), 
 And hips and lickin' lips, and that was it, 
 I had to get Nat-Dog get his things and shit 
 Two to the one from the one to the three, 
 I like good pussy and I like good trees, 
 Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe and I get more ass then a toilet seat, 
 Three to the one for the one to the three, 
 I met a bad nitch last night at the Dee (?), 
 Let me tell you how I made her leve with me, conversation and Hennessy (sp*)

 Heard motherfuckers talk sleeve (?) and drop, 
 If I ain't got a weapon I'm gon pick up a rock, 
 And when I buss your ass, I'm goin' to continue to box, 
 Get your ass off the wall with your two left fee, 
 It's real easy just follow the beat, 
 Don't let that fly girl pass you by, 
 Look real close 'cause stobe light fly (?) 
 We bout to have a party, (turn the music up) 
 Let's get it started, (go head shake your butt)

 Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up 
 Some moves they got retarted (?) 
 Suppose somebodys body

 Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me,

 Swish but don't spit it, Swallow and I'll finish yeah 
 Me and Nate D-O-double G, lookin' for a couple bit-chez with some double Ds,

 Apple bottem jeans and a big ol butt 
 Some moves they got retarted (?) 
 Suppose somebodys body 
 I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on, 
 Knows that can but she won't say no, (now) 
 Look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be, 
 Tonight I wanna slut, would you be mine? 
 Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine 
 Now I hope you don't get mad at me, but I told Nate you was a freak, 
 He said he wasn't a slut, hope you don't mind, I told him how you like it from behind,
