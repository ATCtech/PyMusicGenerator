The days are cold livin' without you 
 The nights are long, I'm growing older 
 I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you 
 You may be gone, but you're never over 
 If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud 
 Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found 
 That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now 
 You try, it'll be them doors, on Dre's Phantom believe me clowns 
 That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me 
 Off of this course, blow me 
 Bitch I do this all for the sport only 
 But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie 
 And the balls in my court and it's lonely 
 On top of the world when you're the only 
 One with the balls and your shorts 
 To leave them jaws on the floor with no re- 
 Morse, remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie 
 So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna 
 I'm not gonna stop the saga 
 Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin' the floors 
 With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch 
 And it won't be, long till this sport is O-V- 
 E-R, just blazin' and we knockin' them doors and no we 
 Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be 
 Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me 
 Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P 
 Let me guide you through the smoke G 
 If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely 
 No one who knew me like you will ever know me 
 I don't think you understand how much you meant to me 
 The days are cold livin' without you 
 The nights are long, I'm growing older 
 I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you 
 You may be gone, but you're never over 
 And it don't stop (oh) 
 And it don't quit (oh) 
 And it don't stop (oh) 
 And it don't quit (oh) 
 And I miss you (oh) 
 I just miss you (oh) 
 I just miss you (oh) 
 Homie I'll never forget you (no) 
 For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life 
 So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite 
 Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself 
 Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself 
 Yeah it's the best thing I could do right now for you Doodi is to rap 
 So I'm a fuck till I die, yeah I'm a do it to death 
 And itstead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life 
 Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'm a need two mics 
 Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right 
 There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped 
 Just finished the rhyming and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor 
 They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered 
 So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process 
 Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous 
 But this depression ain't takin' me hostage 
 I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways 
 You had faith in me always 
 Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes 
 Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards 
 And I'm a show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes 
 I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below 
 Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you 
 I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you 
 Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you 
 You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew 
 You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you 
 You told me nah Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew 
 I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew 
 There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof 
 Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you 
 Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do 
 Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through 
 So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you 
 I love you Doodi 
 The days are cold livin' without you 
 The nights are long, I'm growing older 
 I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you 
 You may be gone, but you're never over 
 And it don't stop (oh) 
 And it don't quit (oh) 
 And it don't stop (oh) 
 And it don't quit (oh) 
 And I miss you (oh) 
 I just miss you (oh) 
 I just miss you (oh) 
 Homie I'll never forget you (no)
