Nah man, not quite finished yet 
 You know what I think 
 You just trying to pull a motherfucking fast one I'm mad 
 You just hurt my god damn feelings and that was the last one I had 
 Does this look like an arcade tryna play games see this dull blade 
 See the silhouette of a stuck up in your walkway 
 Better cooperate 
 Or get sauteed on a rotisserie 
 Havin' a hard time 
 MC's get so quiet that you can here a motherfucking dog whistle when I walk by 
 Cold heaters while a mule stuntin none of that it's like a fuckin' fall guy 
 I don't cash my Mercedes at the midnight I treat it like I'm more black 
 Cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men 
 That thing motor so big you could fit a midget in it's engine 
 Bitch give me them digits while you cringe 
 Not by the hair of my chiny chin chin 
 But I spin spin even ten cents on your sense 
 When did you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny shit 
 If I think a penny's pretty 
 Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me

 Cause you can be your ass that we gon get a crackin' 
 Like the crack in the titans when when they clashin get your brains bashin so bad 
 You gon have kirk O'bane askin an autograph on a bloodstained napkin 
 Unfashionable about as rational as a rash in a fags asshole
