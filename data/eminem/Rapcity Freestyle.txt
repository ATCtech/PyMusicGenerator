Whoa nelly, 
 Tell Angelina Jolie I'm ready, 
 With petroleum jelly, 
 To smear it all over me belly, 
 And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly, 
 And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli, 
 And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly, 
 A motel 6 or 8 it hink they both could be helly, 
 I fucked, then I quieted and told her email me, 
 And don't call me, I'll call you, can you feel me? Bitch do you smell me? 
 Animal instinct, cannabalistic, I just ran out of lipstick, man I'm a 
 Twisted, sick, sadistic, son of a bitch 
 6-6-6, broke his crucifix made out of sticks then fixed it 
 Chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick 
 Now play it back-wards muscle relaxers mixed with, 
 Liquid, 
 The lie to this delutifar quick fix, 
 Your delusional illusions look realistic...
