Eminem 
 Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking 
 We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet 
 That's eight million miles in the sky 
 Please undo your seat belt for take off 
 You are now free to smoke about the cabin 
 Dr. Dre 
 I'm Dre from back in the day from 
 N.W.A. 
 from black and the grey from 
 Chokin' a bitch to smacking her face from 
 Stackin' up bodies to racking AKs up from 
 Racking up hits to stacking them crates up 
 I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm 
 And we're what's happening in rap entertainment 
 Me and Shady far as competition faggot there ain't none 
 Eminem 
 Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man 
 Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron 
 Soon as the blades vrun vrun they run away from 
 Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from 
 In search of a brain surgeon, the great one 
 Wait it ain't funny man, It's urgent I need one 
 Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun 
 And a emergency squirtgun to spray A1 
 So one more time for old time's sake 
 Dre drop that beat and scratch that break 
 Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way 
 And let's go 
 (you are now smoking with the best, the best) 
 I said one more time for old time's sake 
 Dre drop that beat and scratch that break 
 Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way 
 And let's go 
 (you are now smoking with the best, the best) 
 Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless, a nice environment 
 Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound 
 I surround the hydrants taking lives of firemen 
 Say goodbye, here I am again 
 Naked wives and vicodin 
 Before I begin to get so high pussy boy I could spin 
 Vin vin, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge 
 Let that boy off the bench coach and throw it to him 
 There he goes in his trench coat and no clothes again 
 Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin 
 I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin 
 Show me nipple I pinch both and throw up a ten 
 Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again 
 The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him 
 Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within 
 That when you wake in the morning next to the porcelain 
 So one more time for old time's sake 
 Dre drop that beat and scratch that break 
 Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way 
 And let's go 
 (you are now smoking with the best, the best) 
 I said one more time for old time's sake 
 Dre drop that beat and scratch that break 
 Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way 
 And let's go 
 (you are now smoking with the best, the best) 
 Dr. Dre 
 Now where there's smoke there's fire 
 Where there's fire, there's flames 
 Where there's flames there's chronic 
 Either you high or you ain't 
 I got no time for no games 
 Eminem 
 Nah-ah he ain't playing 
 He's gonna get the AK and aim it at your brain 
 I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine 
 Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink 
 And it's giving me wings, I believe I can fly 
 While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI 
 It's as easy as pie and as simple as cake 
 Dre get on the mic and make them tremble and shake 
 Dr. Dre 
 Now put your smoke up in the air 
 Raise your Henny and coke 
 And if you really want to get fucked up just let me know 
 We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it 
 Let's get into it, you smoking with the triedest and truest 
 I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up 
 You muthafuckers ain't smoking you just holding shit up 
 Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt 
 I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one 
 'Cause if at first you don't succeed 
 Won't hurt to smoke some weed 
 Now them words are just a little more personal for me 
 Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees 
 Eminem 
 Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech 
 Come on smoke me up cuz, get me contact buzz 
 Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff 
 But this is Earth calling Shady man come on back (what?) 
 Man we're losing him, he won't even respond back fuck 
 Now look at all the pretty women in here 
 (Damn, bitches) 
 Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures 
 I get the thermometer you get the bandages 
 Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bit 
 So one more time for old time's sake 
 Dre drop that beat and scratch that break 
 Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way 
 And let's go 
 (you are now smoking with the best, the best) 
 I said one more time for old time's sake 
 Dre drop that beat and scratch that break 
 Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way 
 And let's go 
 (you are now smoking with the best, the best)
