Weve got a bit of love/hate 
 You take me to the edge 
 Then you hit the breaks 
 I say its over one day 
 But then Im crawling back 
 Begging you to stay 
 We make up and 
 We break up all the time 
 Ill say that I hate a song 
 Then youll go request it 
 The whole night long 
 Some people say its so wrong 
 But even when we fight 
 Girl you turn me on 
 We make up and 
 We break up all the time 
 Were like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 Always like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 No we cant make up our minds 
 Cause when we think 
 Weve got it right 
 We go na na na 
 You wanna party too late 
 But when I do the same 
 All you do is complain 
 You know that 
 It drives me insane 
 But when I get with you 
 Girl you make it okay 
 We make up and 
 We break up all the time 
 Were like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 Always like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 No we cant make up our minds 
 Cause when we think 
 Weve got it right 
 We go na na na 
 Oh whoa it drives me mad 
 Were like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 Always like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 Were like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 Always like na na na 
 Then were like yeah yeah yeah 
 No we cant make up our minds 
 Cause when we think 
 Weve got it right 
 We go na na na
