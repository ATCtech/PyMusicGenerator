Stained coffee cup 
 Just a fingerprint of lipsticks not enough 
 Sleep where you lay 
 Still a trace of innocence on pillow case 
 Waking up 
 Beside you I am a loaded gun 
 I cant contain this anymore 
 Im all yours I got no control 
 No control 
 Powerless 
 And I dont care its obvious 
 I just cant get enough of you 
 The pedals down my eyes are closed 
 No control 
 Taste on my tongue 
 I dont want a wash away the night before 
 In the heat where you lay 
 I could stay right here and burn in it all day 
 Waking up 
 Beside you I am a loaded gun 
 I cant contain this anymore 
 Im all yours I got no control 
 No control 
 Powerless 
 And I dont care its obvious 
 I just cant get enough of you 
 The pedals down my eyes are closed 
 No control 
 Lost my senses 
 Im defenseless 
 Her perfumes holding me ransom 
 Sweet and sour 
 I devour 
 Lying here I count the hours 
 Waking up 
 Beside you Im a loaded gun 
 I cant contain this anymore 
 Im all yours I got no control 
 No control 
 Powerless 
 And I dont care its obvious 
 I just cant get enough of you 
 The pedals down my eyes are closed 
 No control 
 No control 
 No control 
 Powerless 
 And I dont care its obvious 
 I just cant get enough of you 
 The pedals down my eyes are closed 
 No control
