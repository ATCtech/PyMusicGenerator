Once again it's the sinister cynical minister Shady 
 Kryptonite to Superman he's a dentist to Amy 
 Administer of the pain 
 Just finished huffin the paint 
 And muffled the fumes like it 
 Was nothin' because it ain't 
 Anything in his his way 
 His enemies he just slays 
 His venom he sprays 
 Reaches like beams of energy rays 
 Menecing stance 
 He glares making the hairs all on the back of your neck stand 
 Like Dracula yep 
 Spectacular rep he's a tarantula 
 Gargantuan yeah Angela 
 So I command you to start dancin 
 Part Manson part Hannibal 
 Part mechanical shark throwin' 
 Animal parts at Scarlett Johannson 
 Enter my gas chamber 
 Ya gangster? my ass 
 He's got his fangs to your neck 
 He's set to strangle your ass hater 
 Your facin a task greater 
 He's chasin your ass 
 He's got his face in a mask 
 And blood stains on his glass table 
 I'm checking the exposure 
 Of photos of me exposing 
 Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing 
 With or without clothing 
 Next to the decomposing 
 Bodies eroding while I'm dosing off 
 Overdosing 
 Windows opening shutting 
 Doors opening closing 
 I think there's a ghost 
 Too much hydrocodone and codeine 
 I was only supposed to swallow half 
 I took the whole thing 
 I'm not joking 
 I think I just snorted my nosering 
 I need a drink I'm standing over the sink hosing 
 Myself self loathing 'cause I'm on the brink closely 
 I don't wanna think 
 These'll make everything rosy 
 Beverly sings Scream while I'm severing Three toesies 
 Totally frozen while I close in 
 I'm Jodeling Rosy won't you come out to play 
 No sense wasting time 
 Cutting and pasting headlines of the papers 
 Making shrines of my crimes and capers 
 My world's a whirlwind 
 I murdered my girlfriend 
 Go to Europe and put neruphins in my syrup 
 And stir them 
 You've never heard him, like this 
 So don't encourage him 
 The neurosurgeon coke lyrics 
 And lyrics worsen 
 The kind of person 
 To get paid in Kurichs to curse and 
 Eighty spirits of ladies get Shady murdered the virgins 
 Crazy turn of the events that he emerged 
 To go to the world and got rid of all the children 
 Load them into the building 
 And kill'm and bury them in the mud 
 And mildew and he will do what he feels 
 And still can spit drawin the gold like Rumplestilskin 
 Cotton and silk, Motrin and Tylenol three pills 
 The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin 
 Nothin' but crumpled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildred 
 He's amped with it he still shouldn't be healed 
 There's no one as sick as he 
 Emcees will get fricasseed on the grill, then
