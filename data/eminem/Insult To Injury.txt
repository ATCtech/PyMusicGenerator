You think you know me, please 
 You have no idea 
 You think my life is great, shit 
 I cover up the tears 
 But inside my scalp, it starts 
 A burn in hell 
 Thoughts of hurtin' myself and homicide is real 
 But you can't tell 'cause I'm good at hiding myself 
 I've got a lot of problems 
 That I've never shared with no one else 
 I've been to a lot of doctors 
 But the shit never helps 
 They just stuff me with the pills for all the pain that I felt 
 And as we press the gression got me naked in depression 
 Got me playin' Russian Roulette with this smith and wesson 
 Remeniscing back when things were still glistenin' 
 When things was still playin' with a puzzle and pieces werent missin' 
 Those days, I miss them 
 But those days, I kiss them 
 Goodbye for good 
 Those days are the old days 
 Now lets pay the rent before you end up on the wrong day 
 And I'm tired of being broke 
 I'm ready to shake you up 
 Give me all your money bitch and that chain you've got tucked 
 I see you flaunting all that ice 
 You must be ballin' but I don't got shit so hang me your wallet (fades)
