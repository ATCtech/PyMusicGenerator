(Eminem) 
 This thing right here, it's letting all the people know 
 What burnouts talk about. You know, The Chronic... 
 Ooh that buds look scandalous, 
 You hit it too hard you can't handle this, 
 So you smokin' that thing when you pass it to us, 
 With a look in your eyes so devious, 
 You inhale with all you got, suck it down hard till your seeing dots, 
 And your body's on the ground but your mind is not, 
 Cause your livin' la vida smoke-ah 
 Now you're high as a kite (kite, kite) 
 Been tokin' all night (night, night) 
 All night long (all night long) 
 Let me hit that bong, baby, 
 That bong bo-bong bong bong 
 I like to roll a blunt ooh, 
 And smoke it in a pipe too, 
 But best of all, 
 Is that bong bo-bong bong bong 
 You know you love that Cannabis, 
 So pull up a chair and come smoke with us, 
 They call me Crisqo I can bake so much, 
 I like to hotbox the tour bus, 
 Puff, puff, give till its 4/20, 
 This stuff ain't cheap, I need more money, 
 But when I buy that green I get the best they got, 
 'Cause I'm livin' la vida smoke-ah 
 Now I'm high as a kite (kite, kite) 
 I been tokin' all night (night, night) 
 All night long (all night long) 
 Let me hit that bong, baby, 
 That bong bo-bong bong bong, 
 I like to roll a blunt ooh, 
 And smoke it in a pipe too, 
 But best of all, 
 Is that bong bo-bong bong bong.
