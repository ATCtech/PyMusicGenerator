Here I go, lyrically 
 I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm spiritual 
 On the microphone I tear up in stereo 
 I'm like the grand wizard, yes I'm the imperial 
 I have no fucking clue what the fuck I'm doing 
 But frithick mushy your whole life is ruined 
 If you try to step to me your life's in jeopardy 
 'Cause I will seek out... 
 Yes, here we go break it down 
 I got the crown I'm about to take it now 
 Yo I got my man and he's on the guitar 
 And when it comes to lyrics I go so far 
 Like a car that I'm driving surviving on vivrin 
 I'm alive I'm like eye of the tiger 
 And I kick it so... so fucking hard 
 Now frithick mushy go...
