I figured it out 
 I figured it out from black and white 
 Seconds and hours 
 Maybe they had to take some time 
 I know how it goes 
 I know how it goes from wrong and right 
 Silence and sound 
 Did they ever hold each other tight like us? 
 Did they ever fight like us? 
 You and I 
 We dont wanna be like them 
 We can make it til the end 
 Nothing can come between you and I 
 Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us 
 No nothing can come between you and I 
 Oh you and I 
 I figured it out 
 Saw the mistakes of up and down 
 Meet in the middle 
 Theres always room for common ground 
 I see what its like 
 I see what its like for day and night 
 Never together 
 Cause they see things in a different light like us 
 But they never tried like us 
 You and I 
 We dont wanna be like them 
 We can make it til the end 
 Nothing can come between you and I 
 Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us 
 Cause you and I 
 We dont wanna be like them 
 We can make it til the end 
 Nothing can come between you and I 
 Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us 
 No nothing can come between you and I 
 Oh you and I 
 You and I 
 We can make it if we try 
 You and I 
 Oh You and I
