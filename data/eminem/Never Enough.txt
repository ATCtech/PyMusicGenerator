Wanna pull an all nighter 
 And get into something well never forget 
 Wanna stay up and party 
 The weekend away and not know when to quit 
 Wanna drive in the night to the end of the end 
 And go over the edge 
 Wanna wake up with you 
 And say baby lets do it all over again 
 Lips so good I forget my name 
 I swear I could give you everything 
 I dont need my love 
 You can take it you can take it take it 
 I dont need my heart 
 You can break it you can break it break it 
 I just cant get too much of you baby 
 Its never its never enough never enough 
 Its never enough never enough 
 Come on 
 Come on
