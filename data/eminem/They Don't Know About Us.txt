People say we shouldnt be together 
 Were too young to know about forever 
 But I say they dont know 
 What theyre talk talk talking about 
 Cause this love is only getting stronger 
 So I dont want to wait any longer 
 I just want to tell the world 
 That youre mine girl oh 
 They dont know about the things we do 
 They dont know about the I love yous 
 But I bet you if they only knew 
 They would just be jealous of us 
 They dont know about the up all nights 
 They dont know Ive waited all my life 
 Just to find a love that feels this right 
 Baby they dont know about 
 They dont know about us 
 One touch and I was a believer 
 Every kiss it gets a little sweeter 
 Its getting better 
 Keeps getting better all the time girl 
 They dont know about the things we do 
 They dont know about the I love yous 
 But I bet you if they only knew 
 They would just be jealous of us 
 They dont know about the up all nights 
 They dont know Ive waited all my life 
 Just to find a love that feels this right 
 Baby they dont know about 
 They dont know about us 
 They dont know how special you are 
 They dont know what youve done to my heart 
 They can say anything they want 
 Cause they dont know us 
 They dont know what we do best 
 Its between me and you our little secret 
 But I want to tell em 
 I want to tell the world that youre mine girl 
 They dont know about the things we do 
 They dont know about the I love yous I love you 
 But I bet you if they only knew If they only knew 
 They would just be jealous of us They would just be jealous of us 
 They dont know about the up all nights 
 They dont know Ive waited all my life 
 Just to find a love that feels this right Feels so right 
 Baby they dont know about 
 They dont know about us 
 They dont know about the things we do They dont know about us 
 They dont know about the I love yous They dont know about us 
 But I bet you if they only knew 
 They would just be jealous of us 
 They dont know about the up all nights 
 They dont know Ive waited all my life 
 Just to find a love that feels this right 
 Baby they dont know about 
 They dont know about us
