Lickilty Split freestyle: 
 Check this out, Check this out, yo 
 This guy's a choke artist 
 You catch the bad one 
 Your better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun 
 Climbin up this mountian your weak 
 I leave you lost without a paddle floatin shits creek 
 You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, u the new kid on the block 
 Bout to get smacked back to the boon docks 
 Fuckin' Nazi you squak ain't too tight 
 Take sum real advice and form a group with Vinalla Ice 
 And when I tell ya you better use it 
 This guys a hillbilly this ain't Willie Nelson music 
 Trailer trash I choke you to your last breath 
 And have you lookin' foolish like Chedder Bob when he shot himself 
 Silly rabbit I know I don't call you dat like you follow future 
 Like he got carrots up his ass-crack 
 And when you act it up that's when you got jacked up 
 And not stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up 
 I crack your shoulder-blades 
 You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin' in his grave 
 I don't know why they let you out in the dark 
 You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile to the trailer park 
 (Crowd cheers)--- WOO 
 Eminem (rabbit) freestlyes: 
 This guy raps like his parents jerked him 
 He sound's like Eric Sermon, the generic version 
 This whole crowd looks suspicious it's all dudes in here 
 Except for these bitches 
 Oh so I'm a German eh? 
 That's ok you look like a fucking worm with brains 
 These leaders of the free world rookies 
 Lookie how can six dicks beat pussies? 
 You talk about shit's creek 
 Bitch you can be up piss creek with paddles this deep 
 Your still gonna sink 
 You're a disgrace 
 Yeah they call me rabbit this is the turtle race 
 They can't get with me spiting this shit wickitly lickilty shot 'cause spikity spit split lickitly 
 Then I'm a turn around with a great smile 
 And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile
