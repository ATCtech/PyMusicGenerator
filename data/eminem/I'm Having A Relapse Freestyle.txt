How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges 
 Hes already got life in jail man what the hell is his problem 
 Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leafs make me hella demonic 
 They compelled me to kill this elderly man 
 And I get these panic attacks, 
 Pop a xanax relapse 
 Tryin' to stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequins ass 
 Then I get manic depressed 
 See the orthodontist get gas masked 
 Man it's kick ass 
 The first thing I put on is the mask 
 Speakin' of masks 
 Man it ain't to late to have a change of pace 
 And take it off and show my face 
 So you can see the things you facin 
 Slice you up and cook you after you murder my strangulation 
 That's bacon souffle you makin' ain't you but thank you jason 
 There goes one more coma 
 Through the blood force trauma 
 Just give me one more soma 
 And I'll be done for Omama 
 Go in the damn broom closet 
 Another valium lost it 
 Shovin the vacuum nozzle 
 Down the bathroom faucet 
 It seems like everyday I get a little flakier 
 The medication is making my hands a little shakier 
 Hand me that 18 month old baby to shake him up 
 It'll only take me a 
 Second to choke his trachea 
 Breakin his neck in 80 some places 
 Baby here shady comes lady 
 Hes got the razor for blazin' the chchchchay ainsaw baby 
 You bubublunderin bumblin mumumumublin dum dums yeah 
 Here I come come you hear the rumblin rum rum 
 There something inside the blue talkin' that drum drum 
 My head and torso someone whered it come from 
 Whose it belong to maybe the girl with the long blonde hair 
 Who disappeared and left the cheer leader pom poms 
 Clearly there something wrong 'cause she didn't come home 
 She's missing where is she something is going on 
 I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitch fork with the long prongs 
 Now everybody get your dance on to my dance song
