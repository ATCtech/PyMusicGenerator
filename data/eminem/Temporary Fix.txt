Niall: 
 Saw your body language and I know how youre feeling 
 You look like the kind of girl whos tired of speaking 
 Standing with somebody but he doesnt know what you like 
 You caught my attention you were looking at me first 
 All that I can see is you waking up in my tshirt 
 If youre not hooked on anything right now I can be your vice 
 Liam: 
 All you need to know is 
 All: 
 You can call me when youre lonely when you cant sleep 
 Ill be your temporary fix 
 You control me even if its just tonight 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 You can call me when you feel like Im your good time 
 Ill be your temporary fix 
 You can own me and well call this what you like 
 Niall: 
 Let me be your good night 
 Harry: 
 The night is on your lips and I feel like Im locked in 
 Theres a million lights I dont care if theyre watching 
 Your bodys saying everything I dont have to read your mind 
 Feel you on my neck while Im calling a taxi 
 Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat 
 Now were taking off now were taking it off tonight 
 Liam: 
 All you need to know is 
 All: 
 You can call me when youre lonely when you cant sleep

 You control me even if its just tonight

 Ill be your temporary fix 
 You can own me and well call this what you like 
 Harry:

 Let me touch you where your heart is 
 And if youre feeling the weakness
