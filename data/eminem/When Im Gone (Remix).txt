Tupac: 
 Let us pray, heavenly father here a nigga down here 
 I see mothers in black cryin' brothers who packs dime's plus everybody's high to doped up to ask why. watching our own downfall witnessing the end. it's like we don't believe in god 'cause we living in sin. I asked my homie on the block why he strapped he laughed pointed his pistol at the cop car past and blast.its just another murder nobody morns no more. my tear drops gettin' bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin' for. in just a minuet we casket little babies victims of a stray from drug dealers gone crazy, maybe its just the drugs or visions of how the block was. crack came and it was strange how it rocked us. perhaps the underlying facts they hide explain genocide, its when we ride on our own kind. what is it we don't feel. reflections in the mirror. we can't escape fate [fading out] 
 (Chorus: eminem) 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling 
 And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain 
 Just smile back 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling 
 And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain 
 Just smile back... 
 Tupac: 
 There go my oscars all I see is terror. I hate the man in the mirror cause his reflections just turns the pain rilla. times involved my gat and murdering in mass amounts. I started out as a beginner entered a criminal life stile and became the center. I made my money and vacate evade prison work from the chosen one outcast unforgiving. and all henesy and weed getting high. the pain I feel inside you know it's like I'm liven just to die I fall on my knees and beg for mercy. not knowing I'm not worthy living life thinking no man can hurt me. so I'm asking before I lay me down to sleep. before you judge me look at all the shit you did to me. my misery I rose up from the slums. 
 Made it out the flames in my search for fame. will I change. (fading out) 
 (Chorus: eminem) 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling 
 And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain 
 Just smile back 
 And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn 
 Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice 
 Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling 
 And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain 
 Just smile back...
