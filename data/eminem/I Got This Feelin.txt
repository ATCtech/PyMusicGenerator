(Phone Rings) 
 Eminem 
 Hello? 
 What Up? 
 Hello? 
 Yo I Can-I Can't hear you 
 Let me call you right back 
 I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do 
 I got this feeling in my bones, I might die soon 
 The F.B.I. might be tryin' to pull my files soon 
 I might be walking, blindfold into a typhoon 
 I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky 
 Right outside of the window, of my living room 
 And if they do 
 Then you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes 
 If I don't try to, record as much before I do 
 The plan is to have as many in the can as I can 
 As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man 
 Blank stare, dead pan 
 Look on my face is a gaze into space 
 As I wait to be scooped up in that van 
 Just mysteriously disappear into thin air 
 And they gon say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere 
 And I go down into history 
 As the blood suckin leech 
 Who hid behind the freedom of speech 
 Tried to take the fifth amendment 
 Use it, twist it and bend it 
 And ended up dying a villain out the hero's splinters 
 The bendest way to end this 
 I can feel the trim its tremendous 
 In remembrance of September 11th 
 Flashback to September 7th 
 When Tupac was murdered in Vegas 
 He said that he predicted his own death 
 Let us never forget it 
 Should we ever live to regret it 
 Like the day that John F. Kennedy was assassinated 
 In broud day by that crazed lunatic with a gun 
 Who just happened to work in the same block 
 In the library book depository where 
 The president would go for a little Friday stroll 
 Shots fired from the Grassy knoll 
 But they don't know 
 But do they? 
 Who's they for 'em to say? 
 Tushay, we're all gonna revolve in a spook-ay 
 This is as bout as cook-ay as I've ever felt now 
 Countdown a nuclear meltdown 
 7,6,5,4 3,2,1 
 You can run 
 You can do what you want to 
 But you you know you ain't gonna do nothing 
 When its time, it's your time 
 You are the prime target 
 You have become 
 Public enemy number one
