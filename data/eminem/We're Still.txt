 Peace to Thirstin Howl, A. L., and 
 Wordsworth 
 My mother smoked crack I had a 
 Premature birth 
 I'm just a nerve cursed with badly 
 Disturbed nerves 
 You wanna be the one to step up 
 And get served first 
 99% of aliens prefer 
 Earth 
 I come here to rule the planet, 
 Starting with your turf 
 I hid a secret message inside of a 
 Word search 
 With smeared letters runnin' 
 Together in blurred spurts 
 I hang with male chauvinist pigs 
 And perverts 
 Who point water pistols at women 
 And squirt shirts 
 Been a bad boy since diapers and 
 Gerber's 
 My first words were bleep bleep and 
 Curse curse 
 Never had it and I still don't 
 Deserve dirt 
 My breath still stinks and I'm on 
 My third cert 
 Yanking out my stitches, and hollering "nurse nurse, 
 You said this shot would numb it, 
 Chick it just hurts worse!"
