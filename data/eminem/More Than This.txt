Ooh 
 Im broken 
 Do you hear me? 
 Im blinded 
 Cause you are everything I see 
 Im dancing alone 
 Im praying 
 That your heart will just turn around 
 And as I walk up to your door 
 My head turns to face the floor 
 Cause I cant look you in the eyes and say 
 When he opens his arms 
 And holds you close tonight 
 It just wont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this yeah 
 When he lays you down I might just die inside 
 It just dont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this 
 I can love you more than this 
 If Im louder 
 Would you see me? 
 Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me? 
 Cause we are the same 
 You saved me but when you leave its gone again 
 And then I see you on the street 
 In his arms I get weak 
 My body fails Im on my knees 
 Praying 
 When he opens his arms 
 And holds you close tonight 
 It just wont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this yeah 
 When he lays you down I might just die inside 
 It just dont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this 
 Yeah Ive never had the words to say 
 But now Im asking you to stay 
 For a little while inside my arms yeah 
 And as you close your eyes tonight 
 I pray that you will see the light 
 Thats shining from the stars above 
 When he opens his arms 
 And holds you close tonight 
 It just wont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this 
 Cause I can love you more than this yeah 
 When he lays you down I might just die inside 
 It just dont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this yeah 
 When he opens his arms 
 And holds you close tonight 
 It just wont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this yeah 
 When he lays you down I might just die inside Im broken 
 It just dont feel right 
 Cause I can love you more than this 
 I can love you more than this
