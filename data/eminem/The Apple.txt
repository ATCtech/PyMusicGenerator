I'm a little nutty and I know it 
 But if you go back and take a look at my history 
 You will see that I'm not the only one who's off his rocker 
 There were many before me 
 I was always labelled the black sheep of the family 
 What a bad seed I grow to be 
 But if you take a look at us now 
 You'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree 
 (Haha) 
 All right, look 
 I'ma tell you the story from my side 
 Maybe you'll understand 
 Check it out 
 You done witnessed unexplainable shit 
 Too insane to explain 
 People run from what the just don't get 
 Maybe shady shoulda just hit 'em with a little bit 
 Did I spit too soon? should I of spoon fed 'em it? 
 But I was just so eager to prove I was even worth 
 Being in the same league or the room with 
 Of the people of whom I was in 
 Every now and then I look up like I was seeking approval 
 Was it because of the pigment of my skin 
 Or was it a figment of my imagination 
 Maybe it bothered me more than it did them 
 Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then 
 But to me it was, see what it was was 
 I had developed the complex from being judged 
 Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who (?) 
 I'm in the booth staring back to see who's mugs 
 I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb (?) was from proof 
 And the rest of the group backed him up 
 And no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals 
 It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal 
 Sometimes I feel like it's just me 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy 
 But take a look at my family 
 Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree 
 I said... 
 Sometimes I feel like it's just me 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy 
 But take a look at my family 
 Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree 
 Ever since my mother was pregnant 
 With her second egg 'cause she said 
 That I had a baby sister who fell out of the window 
 I was too young to remember 
 Kansas city projects 
 I was like 5, 6, and how come 
 I remember malcolm, isaac, and boogie 
 If it was the projects in missouri? 
 Cause those're my best friends until isaac 
 Took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back 
 And ended up getting jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and 70-some stitches 
 Which is still, to this day 
 Why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture 
 Of a fictitious little sister who never existed 
 And this is why part of my life's so twisted 
 But I can never be as sick as that bitch is 
 And, by the way, that picture's one of my relatives 
 Sometimes I feel like it's just me 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy 
 But take a look at my family 
 Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree 
 I said... 
 Sometimes I feel like it's just me 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy 
 But take a look at my family

 You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain 
 To see why everything I say is so insane 
 What's different about my brain 
 That separates me from other players in this game? 
 On the surface, it may seem like a scheme 
 Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy 
 But that's the last thing I need is for people 
 To walk around feeling sorry for me (me) 
 And I'm not a g, never claimed to be 
 I gave my vest to cashis, just hope he 
 Don't need it more than me 
 But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef 
 But if it comes our way, what do we, turn the other cheek? 
 Come on 
 Sometimes I feel like it's just me 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy 
 But take a look at my family 
 Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree 
 I said... 
 Sometimes I feel like it's just me 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy 
 But take a look at my family
