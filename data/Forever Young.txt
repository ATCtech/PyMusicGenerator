Lets dance in style lets dance for a while   Heaven can wait were only watching the skies   Hoping for the best but expecting the worst   Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?   Let us die young or let us live forever   We dont have the power but we never say never   Sitting in a sandpit life is a sure trip   The musics for the sad man   Forever young   I wanna be forever young   Do you really wanna live forever forever?   Forever young   Some are like water some are like the heat   Some are a melody and some are the beat   But sooner or later they all will be gone   Why dont they stay young?   Its hard to get older without a cause   I dont wanna perish like the fading horse   Youth is like diamonds in the sun   And diamonds are forever   Forever young   I wanna be forever young   Do you really wanna live forever   Forever or never?   Forever young   I wanna be forever young   Do you really wanna live forever   Forever or never?   So many adventures couldnt happen today   So many songs we forgot to play   So many dreams are swinging out of the blue   We let em come true   Forever young   I wanna be forever young   Do you really wanna live forever   Forever or never?   Forever young   I wanna be forever young   Do you really wanna live forever   Forever or never?   Forever young   I wanna be forever young Forever   Do you really wanna live forever   Forever or never?   Forever young   I wanna be forever young   Do you really wanna live forever Forever forever   Forever forever young
