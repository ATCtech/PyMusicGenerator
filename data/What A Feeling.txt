Through the wire through the wire through the wire   Im watching her dance dress is catching the light   In her eyes theres no lies no lies   But theres no question shes not in a disguise   With no way out and a long way down   Everybody needs someone around   And I cant hold you too close now   Through the wire through the wire   What a feeling to be right here beside you now   Holding you in my arms when the air ran out   And we both started running wild the sky fell down   But youve got stars theyre in your eyes   And Ive got something missing tonight   What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow   I wish I could be there now   Through the wire through the wire through the wire   Im watching you like this imagining youre mine   Its too late its too late am I too late?   Tell me now am I running out of time?   With no way out and a long way down   Everybody needs someone around   But I cant hold you too close now   Through the wire through the wire   What a feeling to be right here beside you now   Holding you in my arms when the air ran out   And we both started running wild the sky fell down   But youve got stars theyre in your eyes   And Ive got something missing tonight   What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow   I wish I could be there now   Whatever chains are holding you back holding you back   Dont let em tie you down   Whatever chains are holding you back holding you back   Tell me you believe in that   What a feeling to be right here beside you now   Holding you in my arms when the air ran out   And we both started running wild the sky fell down   But youve got stars theyre in your eyes   And Ive got something missing tonight   What a feeling to be a king beside you somehow   I wish I could be there now
