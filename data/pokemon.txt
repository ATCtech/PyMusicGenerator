I want to be the very best like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each pokemon to understand the power thats inside
Pokemon gotta catch em all
Its you and me
I know its my destiny pokemon
Oh youre my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon gotta catch em all a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and Ill teach you
Pokemon
Gotta catch em all gotta catch em all
Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
And I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
Come with me the time is right
theres no better team
Arm in arm well win the fight
Its always been our dream
Pokemon gotta catch em all
Its you and me
I know its my destiny pokemon
Whoa youre my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon gotta catch em all a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
you teach me and Ill teach you
Pokemon
Gotta catch em all gotta catch em all

Gotta catch em all gotta catch em all

Gotta catch em all
Pokemon

Pokemon gotta catch em all
Its you and me
I know its my destiny pokemon
