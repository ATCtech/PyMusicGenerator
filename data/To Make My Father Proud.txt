To make my father proud 
 To make my mother smile 
 I need not conquer worlds or fame 
 Not set the pace for style 
 If I can follow through 
 On what they gave me as my tools 
 Ill find a way to sail my course 
 Avoiding ships of fools 
 If I dont come up number one 
 Ill stand not well apart 
 As one for numbered numbers 
 When knowing in my heart 
 Ive done all to be done 
 To always do my best 
 By listening to me myself 
 So he can do or else 
 Of without compromise 
 Shall follow the feel of constant care 
 In my eleventh hour 
 Ill be a man the way 
 To face whatever falls my way 
 Prepared that are a shame 
 To just be called a part of God 
 For which I have been named 
 A man and a womans youngest son 
 While growing still a child 
 And that will make my father proud 
 And make my mother smile 
 Proud
