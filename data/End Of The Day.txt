I told her that I loved her was not sure if she heard 
 The roof was pretty windy and she didnt say a word 
 Party died downstairs had nothing left to do 
 Just me her and the moon 
 I said youre on fire babe 
 Then down came the lightning on me 
 Love can be frightening for sure 
 All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want 
 And you say what you say 
 And you follow your heart even though itll break sometimes 
 All I know at the end of the day is you love who you love 
 There aint no other way 
 If theres something Ive learnt from a million mistakes 
 Youre the one that I want at the end of the day 
 At the end of the day 
 Youre the one that I want at the end of the day 
 Said the night was over I said its forever 
 Twenty minutes later wound up in the hospital 
 The priest thinks its the devil my mum thinks its the flu 
 But girl its only you 
 I said youre on fire babe 
 Then down came the lightning on me 
 Love can be frightening for sure 
 All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want 
 And you say what you say 
 And you follow your heart even though itll break sometimes 
 All I know at the end of the day is you love who you love 
 There aint no other way 
 If theres something Ive learnt from a million mistakes 
 Youre the one that I want at the end of the day 
 When the sun goes down 
 I know that you and me and everything will be alright 
 And when the citys sleeping 
 You and I could stay awake and keep on dreaming 
 You and I could stay awake and keep on dreaming 
 All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want 
 And you say what you say 
 And you follow your heart even though itll break sometimes 
 All I know at the end of the day is you love who you love At the end of the day 
 There aint no other way 
 If theres something Ive learnt from a million mistakes 
 Youre the one that I want at the end of the day At the end of the day yeah 
 At the end of the day 
 Youre the one that I want at the end of the day At the end of the day 
 Youre the one that I want at the end of the day
