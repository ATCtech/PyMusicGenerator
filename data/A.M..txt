Wont you stay til the AM? 
 All my favorite conversations 
 Always made in the AM yeah yeah 
 Feels like this could be forever tonight 
 Break these clocks forget about time 
 There could be a World War 3 goin on outside 
 You and me were raised in the same part of town 
 Got these scars on the same ground 
 Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time? 
 Wont you stay til the AM? 
 All my favorite conversations 
 Always made in the AM 
 Cause we dont know what were saying 
 Were just swimming round in our glasses 
 And talking out of our asses 
 Like were all gonna make it yeah yeah 
 Feels like this could be forever right now 
 Dont wanna sleep cause were dreaming out loud 
 Trying to behave but you know that we never learned how 
 You and me were raised in the same part of town 
 Got these scars on the same ground 
 Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time? 
 Wont you stay til the AM? 
 All my favorite conversations 
 Always made in the AM 
 Cause we dont know what were saying 
 Were just swimming round in our glasses
