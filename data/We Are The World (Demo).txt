There is a time when we should hear the certain calls 
 Cause the world it seems its right in this climb 
 Cause theres a chance for taking in needing our own lives 
 It seems we need nothing at all 
 I used to feel that I should give away my heart 
 And it shows that fear of needing it there 
 Then I read the headlines and it said theyre dying there 
 And it shows that we must heed instead 
 We are the world 
 We are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So lets start giving 
 Theres a chance were taking 
 Were taking our own lives 
 Its true well make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares 
 Cause you know that they can feed them all 
 Then I read the paper and it said that youve been denied 
 And it shows the second we will call 
 We are the world 
 We are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So lets start giving 
 Theres a chance were taking 
 Were taking our own lives 
 Its true well make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Now theres a time when we must love them all 
 And it seems that life it dont make love at all 
 But if youd been there and Ill love you more and more 
 It seems in life I didnt do that 
 We are the world the world 
 We are the children are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day
