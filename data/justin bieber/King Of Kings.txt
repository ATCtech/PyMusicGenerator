Thoughts in my head thinking about you and me 
 My mind is so full thinkin' that it's meant to be 
 All I need if for you to try to agree, see that it could work 
 I know that you're afraid 
 That you're gonna get hurt 
 I need to know where this is going, my heart's full 
 Now my love, yea, it's overflowing 
 I gotta show you a place where I go to just think about things 
 It's the top of the world, with the king of kings
