Mmm, mmm, yeah 
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do, oh yeah 
 Gotta change my answering machine 
 Now that I'm alone 
 'Cause right now it says that we can't come to the phone 
 And I know it makes no sense 
 'Cause you walked out the door 
 But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore 
 It's ridiculous, it's been months 
 And for some reason I just can't get over us 
 And I'm stronger than this 
 Enough is enough 
 No more walkin' round with my head down 
 I'm so over being blue cryin' over you 
 And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears 
 So done with wishing you were still here 
 Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow 
 So why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Gotta fix that calendar I have 
 That's marked July 15th 
 Because since there's no more you 
 There's no more anniversary 
 I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you 
 And your memory 
 And how every song reminds me 
 Of what used to be 
 That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears 
 So done with wishing you were still here 
 Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow 
 So why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Leave me alone 
 Leave me alone, stupid love songs 
 Don't make me think about her smile 
 I'm letting go, turning off the radio 
 'Cause I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears 
 So done with wishing you was still here 
 Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow 
 So why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears 
 So done with wishing you was still here 
 Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow 
 So why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Why can't I turn off the radio? 
 And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears 
 So done with wishin' you were still here 
 Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow 
 Why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Why can't I turn off the radio? 
 Why can't I turn off the radio?
