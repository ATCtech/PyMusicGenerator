 I was wonderin' 'bout your mama 
 Did she get that job she wanted? 
 Sell that car that gave her problems? 
 I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh) 
 Know you're wonderin' why I been callin' 
 Like I got ulterior motives 
 I know we didn't end this so good 
 But you know we had something so good 
 So I'm wonderin' 
 Can we still be friends? (ah-ah) 
 Can we still be friends? (ah-ah) 
 Doesn't have to end (ah-ah) 
 And if it ends, can we be friends? 
 Can we be friends? 
 Can we be friends? 
 Wonderin' if you've got a body 
 To hold you tighter since I left (since I left) 
 Wonderin' if you think about me (ooh-ooh) 
 Actually, don't answer that (uh-huh) 
 Know you're wonderin' why I been callin' 
 Like I got ulterior motives 
 I know we didn't end this so good 
 But you know we had something so good 
 So I'm wonderin' 
 Can we still be friends? (ah-ah) 
 Can we still be friends? (ah-ah) 
 Doesn't have to end (ah-ah) 
 And if it ends, can we be friends? 
 Can we be friends? 
 Can we be friends? 
 And if it ends, can we be friends? 
 Know you're wonderin' why I been callin' 
 Like I got ulterior motives 
 Know we didn't end this so good 
 But you know we had something so good 
 I'm wonderin' 
 Can we still be friends? (ah-ah) 
 Can we still be friends? (ah-ah) 
 Doesn't have to end (ah-ah) 
 And if it ends, can we be friends?
