 I wanna ride 
 I-I wanna ride 
 When I wake up I-I-I-I first think of you (of you) 
 I really like you and I hope you like me too (me too) 
 Sky's the limit for me and you 
 I could be your queen but you could be my boo oh whoa 
 We could go anywhere, to the moon and through air 
 Go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care 
 Yeah This is true, Wanna be with you 
 And I just wanna ride with you 
 I wanna ride I-I wanna ride

 Whenever I'm with you, you make me feel special 
 And now my problems- they go right out the door 
 I love it when you call me "baby", (baby) 
 It's you I adore (adore) 
 We could go anywhere, to the moon and through air 
 Go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care

 And I just wanna ride with you

 Go slow right now (go slow) 
 Let the bass go loud (yeah) 
 Let that boom boom pow
