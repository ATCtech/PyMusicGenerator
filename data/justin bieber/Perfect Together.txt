I'm not perfect sometimes. 
 No you're not perfect sometimes. 
 But even when it's wrong it feels right. 
 'Cause we're perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Wo-oh... 
 It's amazing. 
 So amazing. 
 That we are still here, yeah. 
 'Cause we're changing. 
 Re-arraging. 
 But I still see you clear. 
 How can I love you more than me? 
 Tell me the way you and I can fix it. 
 I'm not perfect sometimes. 
 No you're not perfect sometimes. 
 But even when it's wrong it feels right. 
 'Cause we're perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Wo-oh... 
 No more lonely nights. 
 No more city lights. 
 And we're not feeling in the worse baby. 
 You know how to hit me baby. 
 Light shines through the house now. 
 Darkest days in the past nights. 
 You don't know what you do to me. 
 How can I love you more than me? 
 Tell me the way you and I can fix it. 
 I'm not perfect sometimes. 
 No you're not perfect sometimes. 
 But even when it's wrong it feels right. 
 'Cause we're perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Perfect together, perfect together. 
 Wo-oh...
