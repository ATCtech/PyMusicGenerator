You worked two jobs, To keep a roof above our heads, You chose, A life for 
 Me, no never gave up, I admire you, For the strength you've instilled in 
 Me, You were so young, You were just my age, when you had me mom, You were 
 So brave. There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way. And I know you 
 Will always be there for me. So when you're lost and you're tired, When 
 You're broken in two, Let my love take you higher, 'Cause I, I still turn to 
 You. I still turn to you, I still turn to you. It was '94, the year that 
 Everything started to change, From before, You had to be a woman, You were 
 Forced to change your ways, To change your ways 
 Then you found the Lord, You gave your life to Him, And you could not 
 Ignore, the love he had for you, and I wanted more of your heart. 
 So when you're lost and you're tired, When you're broken in two, Let my 
 Love take you higher, 'Cause I, I still turn to you. I still turn to you, I 
 Still turn to you. 
 I don't know what I'd if you left me, So please don't go away, Everything 
 That you are is who I am, Who I am today. So when you're lost and you're 
 Tired, When you're broken in two, Let my love take you higher, 'Cause I, I 
 Still turn to you. I still turn to you, I still turn to you. 
 To you, to you, to you. I Still Turn to you. To you, to you, to you. Cause 
 I, I turn to you
