All right... aha... yeah 
 Speaking in tongues, yabba dabba dabba da da Volia 
 I'm killin' this caca 
 Call up Lady Gaga, on my, on my telephone 
 Hella dome, yeah, my girl beats, no metronome 
 My new chick, she a yellowbone 
 I buy her yellow stone, 'cause I like it when she got that yellow on 
 So I'm a raptor, tearin it up like a tractor 
 Matter fact, I'm killin' this track, you're a slacker 
 Sack like a sacker, hello Mr. Brady 
 Tell 'im leave his hair to the guy who sings "Baby" 
 Baby, come and try to save me 
 Lately, I've been hearing these things that sound crazy 
 Like... Speaking in tongues 
 All right, stop, drop and roll, Justin Bieber is on fire 
 Its time to realize its time to call me Young Sire 
 You're the seller, I'm the buyer 
 You're the teller, and I'm hired 
 I'm higher than the highest point, yes, I am flyer 
 And I'm wired to the game, stay dry when it rains 
 I'm tired of the fame, are you proud of the pain? 
 Yes, were the same, yes, I'm insane 
 And my mane hangs down and my puppet got strings 
 I murdered that, 
 Mane, Shawty Mane! Shawty Mane, what you doin' Shawty Mane? 
 I'm Justin Bieber 
 You guys might know me as the guy you know who sings "Baby" 
 You know, uh, I'm a singer, pop singer 
 I'm white (I'm white, I'm white) 
 But, um, I just wanted to do this just to prove that, you know 
 I got skills, on, on, on the rap game 
 So, yeah 
 What up JulKeyz? Yo, I killed that 
 Aight, peace.
