Speak: 
 What? Wait? But yesterday we were... 
 I don't understand 
 We started out, it was perfect nothing but fun 
 And my heart was convinced to say that ur the one 
 And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives 
 Boy was I in for a big surprise 
 With no doubt 
 Walking out thinking that I'm so cool 
 Cause same place, same time everday 
 My locker we meet afterschool 
 If only I didn't make you cry 
 She wouldn't be with another guy 
 Nothing can cure my headache 
 'Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak 
 It's gonna hurt worse, as long as I stay here 
 I know but man just let me lay here 
 Cause this is something that, I can't shake 
 I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak 
 They say its only just as worse as you make it 
 I know but man just let me lay here 
 Now I'm all tore up, taken back, when I was at your door 
 The first time when you said forever I'll be yours 
 Started walking, your hand in my hand 
 Feelings got stronger, u made a promise 
 And whenever I leave it feels like your still with me 
 But it all came crashing down 
 Sitting in my room, I gotta get outta here 
 What am I to do, when I look up and your not there 
 Nothing can cure my headache 
 'Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak 
 It's gonna hurt worse, as long as I stay here (stay here) 
 I know but man just let me lay here 
 Cause this is something that, I can't shake 
 I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak 
 They say its only just as worse as you make it 
 I know but man just let me lay here 
 They say I'm too young for love, 
 I got so much life to live ahead 
 But if only this hump I could get over 
 I know I have to deal with the pain 
 Nothing can cure my headache 
 'Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak 
 It's gonna hurt worse, as long as I stay here (as long as I stay here) 
 I know but man just let me lay here 
 Cause this is something that, I can't shake 
 I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak 
 They say its only just as worse as you make it 
 I know but man just let me lay here
