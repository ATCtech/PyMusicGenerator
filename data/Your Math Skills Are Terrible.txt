[Liam] 
 Youre insecure 
 So half of four 
 Your old brains are not what they were before 
 [Zayn] 
 Add two threes Its fun for us 
 Cause were young and we can still remember stuff 
 [Harry] 
 Everyone else can multiply by sixty 
 Everyone else can add two 
 [All] 
 Now take off one hundred and add on 24 
 Then divide by two and add on seven more 
 And if youre struggling now its not hard to tell 
 You dont know oh oh your math skills are terrible 
 If only you had a mind like me 
 Youd understand how to divide the sum by three 
 And then just add on the age of this OAP 
 You dont know oh oh your math skills are terrible oh oh 
 Its really kinda pitiful
