 In her painted on jeans 
 She dreams of fame

 Shes headed for the big time that means 
 Shes going Hollywood

 To tinsel town 
 Just to pursue her movie star dreams 
 Shes giving hot tricks to men 
 Just to get in 
 When she was taught that thats not clean 
 Because shes only fifteen 
 Shes going Hollywood 
 Shes going Hollywood tonight 
 Shes going Hollywood 
 Shes going Hollywood tonight

 Shes going Hollywood tonight 
 Its true that you may never ever have that chance again 
 That chance again
