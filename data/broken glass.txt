We were so close to something right But were stupid but were stupid but were stupid  We could turn love into a fight Over nothing over nothing over nothing  And the only thing we had in common with each other Was destroying everything we ever touched  So cheers to us and what we had Lets keep dancing on the broken glass And all thats left is smoke and ash So lets keep dancing on the broken glass  Cheers to us and what we had Lets keep dancing on the broken glass Cause when youre high youre bound to crash So lets keep dancing on the broken glass  Lets keep dancing on the broken glass Cheers to us Lets keep dancing on the broken glass  We couldve done this perfectly But were useless but were useless but were useless  Nobody does a tragedy like you and me Cause were ruthless cause were ruthless cause were ruthless  And the only thing we had in common with each other Was destroying everything we ever touched  So cheers to us and what we had Lets keep dancing on the broken glass And all thats left is smoke and ash So lets keep dancing on the broken glass  Cheers to us and what we had Lets keep dancing on the broken glass Cause when youre high youre bound to crash So lets keep dancing on the broken glass  Lets keep dancing on the broken glass And cheers to us Lets keep dancing dancing Lets keep on dancing yeah Lets keep dancing on the broken glass
