Weve got blue skies weve got blue skies 
 It seems like only yesterday 
 You gave your love to me 
 And we made a vow that through the years 
 Our love would always be 
 Whenever doubts would fill my mind 
 Youd brush my fears away 
 Look into my eyes and hold me close 
 And this is what youd say 
 Weve got blue skies now cant you see? 
 Therell never ever be another love for me 
 The pleasant dreams we shared 
 Made our love stronger with each day 
 And the fears that haunted me 
 Seemed like a million miles away 
 When friends we knew would come to me 
 With lies about your love 
 Id tell them happiness and sunny skies 
 Are all were thinking of 
 Were so in love 
 Were thinking of 
 Blue skies 
 Blue skies 
 I see you there youre kissing him 
 How can this really be? 
 Well I guess its time to realize 
 My dreams are more to me 
 And as I walk off thinking 
 What a fool I must have been 
 Like an echo from my lips today 
 I hear you telling him 
 Weve got blue skies now cant you see? 
 Therell never ever be another love for me 
 Weve got blue skies now cant you see? 
 Therell never ever be another love for me 
 Blue skies weve got blue skies 
 Blue skies weve got blue skies 
 Blue skies weve got blue skies oh baby 
 Weve got blue skies now cant you see? 
 Therell never ever be another love for me 
 Weve got blue skies now cant you see? 
 Therell never ever be another love for me 
 Blue skies weve got blue skies 
 Blue skies weve got blue skies 
 Blue skies weve got blue skies oh baby
