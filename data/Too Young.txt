They try to tell us were too young 
 Too young to really be in love 
 They say that loves a word 
 A word weve only heard 
 But cant begin to know the meaning of 
 And yet were not too young to know 
 This love will last though years may go 
 And then someday they may recall 
 We were not to young at all
