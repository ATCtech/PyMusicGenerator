 This is it here I stand 
 Im the light of the world Ill feel grand 
 Got this love I can feel 
 And I know yes for sure it is real 
 And it feels as though Ive seen your face a thousand times 
 And you said you really know me too yourself 
 And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes 
 But you say youre gonna leave it for yourself 
 Oh

 Falling in love wasnt my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on baby just understand 
 This is it I can say 
 Im the light of your world run away 
 We can feel This is real 
 Every time Im in love that I feel 
 And I feel as though Ive known you since a thousand years 
 And you tell me that youve seen my face before 
 And you said to me that you dont want me hanging around 
 Many times wanna do it here before

 Falling in love wasnt my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on baby just understand

 Feel my song we can say 
 And I tell you can feel that way 
 And I feels as though Ive known you for a thousand years 
 And you said you saw my face yourself 
 And you said want to go with you on a while 
 And I know that its really for myself 
 Oh yeah

 Falling in love wasnt my plan 
 I never thought that I would be your lover 
 Come on please dear understand
