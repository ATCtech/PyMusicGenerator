Like a rolling stone 
 (repeated numerous times) 
 If you dig it, you can have it 
 If you want it, you can dig it up 
 Dig it up, dig it up, dig it up 
 If you get it, you can have it 
 If you want it, you can dig it up 
 Dig it up, dig it up, dig it up 
 (repeated numerous times) 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Like the FBI 
 And the CIA 
 And the BBC 
 B. B. King 
 And Doris Day 
 Matt Busby 
 Dig it 
 Dig it 
 Dig it 
 Dig it
