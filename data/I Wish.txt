He takes your hand   I die a little   I watch your eyes   And Im in riddles   Why cant you look at me like that?   When you walk by   I try to say it   But then I freeze   And never do it   My tongue gets tied   The words gets trapped   I hear the beat of my heart getting louder   Whenever Im near you   But I see you with him   Slow dancing   Tearing me apart   Cause you dont see   Whenever you kiss him   Im breaking   Oh how I wish that was me   He looks at you   The way that I would   Does all the things   I know that I could   If only time could just turn back   Cause I got three little words   That Ive always been dying to tell you   But I see you with him   Slow dancing   Tearing me apart   Cause you dont see   Whenever you kiss him   Im breaking   Oh how I wish that was me   With my hands on your waist   While we dance in the moonlight   I wish it was me   That youll call later on   Cause you wanna say good night   Cause I see you with him   Slow dancing   Tearing me apart   Cause you dont see   But I see you with him   Slow dancing   Tearing me apart   Cause you dont see   Whenever you kiss him   Im breaking   Oh how I wish   Oh how I wish   Oh how I wish   That was me me me   Oh how I wish that was me
