Ooh 
 Farewell my summer love farewell 
 Girl I wont forget you 
 Farewell my summer love farewell ooh 
 I found my happiest days 
 When you came to see your grandma in may 
 I bumped into you by the corner store 
 I told you that you sure looked good now 
 Your grandmas house was next to mine 
 We were together most of the time 
 But summers gotten away from us 
 Times moving too fast for us 
 Bye bye 
 Dont turn around 
 Cause you might see me cry 
 Farewell my summer love farewell 
 Girl I wont forget you 
 Farewell my summer love farewell ooh yeah 
 When you return to your hometown 
 And you discuss your trip 
 Will I be the guy that you put down 
 Or someone that you dont forget no? 
 Ill never forget you 
 And maybe next year 
 When youre out of school 
 Youll return but until you do baby 
 Bye bye 
 Dont turn around 
 You might see me cry 
 Farewell my summer love farewell 
 Girl I wont forget you 
 Farewell my summer love farewell yeah 
 Ooh 
 Farewell farewell 
 Ooh 
 Farewell farewell 
 If you remember my name 
 Drop a line 
 Drop a line sometime yeah 
 Yeah ooh 
 Girl I wont forget you 
 Farewell my summer love farewell 
 Girl I wont forget you 
 When you return to your hometown 
 And you discuss your trip 
 Will I be the guy that you put down 
 Or someone that you dont forget no? 
 Ill never forget you 
 And maybe next year 
 When youre out of school 
 Youll return but until you do baby 
 Bye bye 
 Dont turn around 
 You might see me cry 
 Farewell my summer love farewell ooh yeah 
 Farewell my summer love farewell 
 Repeat to fade
