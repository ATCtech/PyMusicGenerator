Another day has gone   Im still all alone   How could this be   Youre not here with me   You never said goodbye   Someone tell me why   Did you have to go   And leave my world so cold   Everyday I sit and ask myself   How did love slip away   Something whispers in my ear and says   That you are not alone   For I am here with you   Though youre far away   I am here to stay   You are not alone   I am here with you   Though were far apart   Youre always in my heart   You are not alone   Alone alone   Why alone   Just the other night   I thought I heard you cry   Asking me to come   And hold you in my arms   I can hear your prayers   Your burdens I will bear   But first I need your hand   Then forever can begin   Everyday I sit and ask myself   How did love slip away   Something whispers in my ear and says   That you are not alone   For I am here with you   Though youre far away   I am here to stay   For you are not alone   And I am here with you   Though were far apart   Youre always in my heart   For you are not alone   Whisper three words   And Ill come runnin   And I girl you know that Ill be there   Ill be there   You are not alone   I am here with you   Though youre far away   I am here to stay   For you are not alone   I am here with you   Though were far apart   Youre always in my heart   For you are not alone   You are not alone   For I am here with you   I am here with you   Though youre far away   Though youre far away   You and me   I am here to stay   For you are not alone   You are always in my heart   For I am here with you   Though were far apart   Youre always in my heart   For you are not alone   Not alone oh   Alone   You are not alone   You are not alone   Say it again   You are not alone   You are not alone   Not alone   Not alone   If you reach out for me girl   In the morning   In the evening   Not alone   Not alone   You and me   Not alone no   Together   Together   Gotta stop being alone   Gotta stop being alone   Believe in me   Gotta stop being alone   Gotta stop being alone   Gotta stop being alone   Not alone oh
