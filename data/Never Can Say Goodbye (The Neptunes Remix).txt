Never can say goodbye 
 No no no no 
 Never can say goodbye 
 Even though the pain and heartache 
 Seems to follow me wherever I go 
 Though I try and try to hide my feelings 
 They always seem to show 
 Then you try to say youre leaving me 
 And I always have to say no 
 Tell me why is it so? 
 That I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no 
 Never can say goodbye 
 Every time I think Ive had enough 
 I start heading for the door 
 Theres a very strange vibration 
 That passes me right through the core 
 It says turn around you fool 
 You know youll love her more and more 
 Tell me why is it so? 
 Dont wanna let you go 
 I never can say goodbye girl 
 Ooh ooh baby 
 I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no no no ooh 
 Oh I never can say goodbye girl 
 Ooh ooh I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no no no ooh 
 Never can say goodbye 
 No no no no 
 Never can say goodbye 
 I keep thinkin that our problems 
 Soon are all gonna work out 
 But theres that same unhappy feeling 
 And theres that anguish theres that doubt 
 Its that same old did you hang up? 
 Cant do with you all the time 
 Tell me why is it so? 
 Dont wanna let you go 
 I never can say goodbye girl 
 Ooh ooh baby I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no no no ooh 
 Oh I never can say goodbye girl 
 Ooh I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no no no ooh 
 Oh I never can say goodbye girl 
 Ooh ooh baby I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no no no ooh ooh 
 I never can say goodbye girl 
 Ooh ooh oh no I never can say goodbye 
 No no no no no no ooh
