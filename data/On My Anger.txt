Baby 
 Now Im mad 
 The world treats me like an everyday dump 
 They call me names threaten my family 
 And I always say 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Tonight 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Its gonna be a bite 
 Honey 
 What you do to me 
 You strike me like a lightning bolt 
 And 
 Baby 
 Wont you stay for awhile 
 Cause fame is treating me insane 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Tonight 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Its gonna be a bite 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Tonight 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Its gonna be a bite 
 And now Im trying to move on 
 Though it feels like nobody loves me 
 And now Im all beat up 
 By the gangster down the street 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Tonight 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Its gonna be a bite 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Tonight 
 On my anger 
 On my anger 
 Its gonna be a bite
