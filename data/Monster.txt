You can look at them coming out the walls 
 You can look at them climbing out the the bushes 
 You can find them when the letters bout to fall 
 He be waiting with his camera on focus 
 Everywhere you seem to turn 
 Theres a monster 
 When you look up in the air theres a monster 
 Paparazzi got you scared like a monster 
 Too bad 
 Oh oh Hollywood its got you jumping like you should 
 Its got you bouncing off the wall 
 Its got you drunk enough to fall 
 Too bad 
 Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror 
 And tell me you like

 Coming at ya rather too fast 
 Mama say mama got you in a zig zag 
 And youre running 
 And youre running just to scape it 
 But theyre gunning for the money 
 So they fake it 
 Everywhere you seem to turn 
 Theres a monster 
 When you look up in the air theres a monster 
 Paparazzi got you scared like a monster 
 Too bad 
 Oh oh Hollywood its got you jumping like you should 
 Its got you bouncing off the wall 
 Its got you drunk enough to fall 
 Too bad 
 Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror 
 And tell me you like what you see
