You dont understand you dont understand 
 What you do to me when you hold his hand 
 We were meant to be but a twist of fate 
 Made it so you had to walk away 
 Cause were on fire we are on fire 
 Were on fire now 
 Yeah were on fire we are on fire 
 Were on fire now 
 1 2 3 
 I dont care what people say when were together 
 You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep 
 I just want it to be you and I forever 
 I know you wanna leave so come on 
 Baby be with me so happily 
 Its 4 AM and I know that youre with him 
 I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin 
 And if he feels my traces in your hair 
 Im sorry love but I dont really care 
 Cause were on fire we are on fire 
 Were on fire now 
 Yeah were on fire we are on fire 
 Were on fire now 
 1 2 3 
 I dont care what people say when were together 
 You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep 
 I just want it to be you and I forever 
 I know you wanna leave so come on 
 Baby be with me so happily 
 So happily

 I dont care what people say when were together 
 You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep 
 I just want it to be you and I forever

 Baby be with me so happily 
 I dont care what people say when were together 
 You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep 
 I just want it to be you and I forever 
 I know you wanna leave so come on 
 Baby be with me so happily
