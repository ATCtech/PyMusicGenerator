Whos gonna be the first one to start the fight?   Whos gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?   Whos gonna be the last one to drive away?   Whos gonna be the last one to forget this place?   We keep taking turns   Will we ever learn?   All spaces between us   Keep getting deeper   Its harder to reach ya   Even though I try   Spaces between us   Hold all our secrets   Leaving us speechless   And I dont know why   Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?   Whos gonna be the first one to compromise?   Whos gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?   Whos gonna be the last one to drive away?   Forgetting every single promise we ever made?   All spaces between us   Keep getting deeper   Its harder to reach ya   Even though I try   Spaces between us   Hold all our secrets   Leaving us speechless   And I dont know why   Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?   We keep taking turns   Will we ever learn?   When will we learn?   All spaces between us   Keep getting deeper   Its harder to reach ya   Even though I try   Spaces between us   Hold all our secrets   Leaving us speechless   And I dont know why   Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?   Whos gonna be the first to say goodbye?   The spaces between us   The spaces between us   The spaces between us   The spaces between us
