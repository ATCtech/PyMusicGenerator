One man, one soul 
 One vision, one goal 
 One golden glance 
 Of what should be 
 One flash of light 
 Oh, happy day 
 One man, one vision 
 That showed the way 
 The bell that rings 
 Inside your mind 
 It shouts, it sings 
 Of changing times 
 The waiting seems eternity 
 The day will dawn of sanity 
 One man, one soul, one vision 
 One race, one goal, one vision 
 One rage that lasts a thousand years 
 One man, one soul, one vision 
 One flash of light 
 Oh, happy day 
 One man, one vision 
 That showed the way 
 The bell that rings 
 Inside your mind 
 It shouts, it sings 
 Of changing times 
 The waiting seems eternity 
 The day will dawn of sanity, yeah 
 One man, one soul, one vision 
 One race, one goal, one vision 
 One rage that lasts a thousand years 
 One man, one soul, one vision 
 Yeah, one vision 
 One soul
