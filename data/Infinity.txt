Down to Earth 
 Keep on falling when I know it hurts 
 Going faster than a million miles an hour 
 Trying to catch my breath someway somehow 
 Down to Earth 
 Its like Im frozen but the world still turns 
 Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning round 
 Moving in reverse with no way out 
 And now Im one step closer to being 
 Two steps far from you 
 When everybody wants you 
 Everybody wants you 
 How many nights does it take to count the stars? 
 Thats the time it would take to fix my heart 
 Oh baby I was there for you 
 All I ever wanted was the truth yeah yeah 
 How many nights have you wished someone would stay? 
 Lie awake only hoping theyre okay 
 Ive never counted all of mine 
 If I tried I know it would feel like infinity 
 Infinity infinity yeah infinity 
 Eyes cant shine 
 Unless theres something burning bright behind 
 Since you went away theres nothing left in mine 
 I feel myself running out of time 
 And now Im one step closer to being 
 Two steps far from you 
 When everybody wants you 
 Everybody wants you 
 How many nights does it take to count the stars? 
 Thats the time it would take to fix my heart 
 Oh baby I was there for you 
 All I ever wanted was the truth yeah yeah 
 How many nights have you wished someone would stay? 
 Lie awake only hoping theyre okay 
 Ive never counted all of mine 
 If I tried I know it would feel like infinity 
 Infinity infinity yeah infinity 
 Infinity infinity 
 How many nights does it take to count the stars? 
 Thats the time it would take to fix my heart 
 Oh baby I was there for you 
 All I ever wanted was the truth yeah yeah 
 How many nights have you wished someone would stay? 
 Lie awake only hoping theyre okay 
 Ive never counted all of mine 
 If I tried I know it would feel like infinity 
 Infinity infinity yeah 
 Infinity
