Ooh my honey 
 You got me working day and night 
 Ooh my sugar 
 You got me working day and night 
 Scratch my shoulder 
 It's aching, make it feel alright 
 When this is over 
 Loving you will be so right 
 I often wonder 
 If loving you will be tonight 
 But what is love, girl 
 If I'm always out of sight (ooh) 
 (That's why) 
 You got me working day and night 
 And I'll be working 
 From sun up to midnight 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You say that working 
 Is what a man's supposed to do 
 But I say it ain't right 
 If I can't give sweet love to you 
 (Ah) 
 I'm tired of thinking 
 Of what my life's supposed to be (well) 
 Soon enough, darling 
 This love will be reality (ah ah) 
 How can you live, girl 
 'Cause love for us was meant to be (well) 
 Then you must be seeing 
 Some other guy instead of me (ooh) 
 (That's why) 
 You got me working day and night 
 And I'll be working 
 From sun up to midnight 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (Hold on) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (I'm so tired, tired now) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (Hold on) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (Hoo, hoo, hoo) 
 You say that working 
 Is what a man's supposed to do 
 But I say it ain't right 
 If I can't give sweet love to you 
 (Well, ah) 
 How can you live, girl 
 'Cause love for us was meant to be (well) 
 Then you must be seeing (woo) 
 Some other guy instead of me (ooh) 
 (That's why) 
 You got me working day and night (I don't understand it) 
 And I'll be working 
 From sun up to midnight 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (Hold on) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (I'm so tired tired now) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (Girl) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (I'm so tired, tired now) 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 You got me working, working day and night 
 (How can I get to you ...)
