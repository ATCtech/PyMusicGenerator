spoken: 
 "My footsteps broke the silence of the pre-dawn hours as I drifted down Bleaker Street, past shop windows, barred against the perils of the night. Up ahead, a neon sign emerged from the fog. The letters glowed red hot, in that way I knew so well, branding a message into my mind. A single word. Hotel." 
 As he came into the window 
 Was the sound of a crescendo 
 He came into her apartment 
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet 
 She ran underneath the table 
 He could see she was unable 
 So she ran into the bedroom 
 She was struck down, it was her doom 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?

 So they came into the outway 
 It was Sunday, what a black day 
 Mouth to mouth resuscitation 
 Sounding heartbeats, intimidations 
 Annie are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie?
