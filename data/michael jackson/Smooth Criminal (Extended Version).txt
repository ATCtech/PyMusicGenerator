As he came into the window 
 Was the sound of a crescendo 
 He came into her apartment 
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet 
 She ran underneath the table 
 He could see she was unable 
 So she ran into the bedroom 
 She was struck down, it was her doom 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie, are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? 
 Annie are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay? 
 There's a sign in the window that he struck you, a crescendo Annie 
 He came into your apartment, left the bloodstains on the carpet 
 Then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom 
 Annie are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie? 
 Annie are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie? 
 Annie are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie? 
 You've been hit by, you've been hit by a smooth criminal 
 So they came into the outway 
 It was Sunday, what a black day 
 Every time I try to find him 
 He's leaving no clues left behind him 
 And they have no way of knowing 
 Of the suspect, or what to expect 
 Mouth to mouth resuscitation 
 Sounding heartbeats, intimidations 
 Annie are you okay? So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie? 
 Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?) So, Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?) Are you okay Annie? 
 Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?) So, Annie are you okay? (Annie are you okay?)
