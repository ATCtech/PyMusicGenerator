Let me tell ya now 
 When I had you to myself 
 I didn't want you around 
 Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd 
 But someone picked you from the bunch 
 When glance was all it took 
 Now it's much too late for me to take a second look 
 Oh baby give me one more chance 
 (Show you that I love you) 
 Won't you please let me 
 (Back to your heart) 
 Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go 
 (Let you go baby) 
 But now since I see you in his arms 
 (I want you back) 
 Yes I do now 
 (I want you back) 
 Ooh ooh baby 
 (I want you back) 
 Ya ya ya ya 
 (I want you back) 
 (I want you back) 
 Back...

 Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it 
 Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it 
 Stop! The love you save may be your own 
 Darling, take it slow 
 Or some day you'll be all alone 
 You'd better stop 
 The love you save may be your own 
 Darling, look both ways before you cross me 
 You're headed for the danger zone 
 Slow down 
 Slow down 
 Slow down 
 Slow down 
 S is for "Save it" 
 T is for "Take it slow" 
 O is for "Oh, no" 
 P is for "Please, please, don't go"
