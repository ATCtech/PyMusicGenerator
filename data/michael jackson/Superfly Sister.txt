 Love ain't what it used to be 
 That is what they're tellin' me 
 Push it in, stick it out 
 That ain't what it's all about 
 He wanna do somethin' freaky to you 
 He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl 
 He wanna shake it up, shake it down 
 Doin' it right 
 He wanna jump back, half flap, doin' it right 
 He wanna lay you down 
 Turn it up 
 Kickin' it loose 
 He wanna fly high, nigh high 
 Baby for you's 
 He wanna motormouth 
 Float around 
 Baby the back 
 He wanna shake it up, shake it down 
 Moving rou-ha-hound 
 Love ain't what it used to be (hee) 
 That is what they're tellin' me 
 Push it in, stick it out 
 That ain't what it's all about (woh) 
 Susie like to agitate 
 Get the boy and make him wait 
 Mother's preaching Abraham 
 Brothers they don't give a damn 
 He wanna do something freaky to you 
 He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl 
 He wanna do it up, make it hot 
 Deep in the night 
 He wanna eyeball 
 Get all 
 Playin' it right 
 He wanna turn the key 
 Work the sheets 
 Groove to the left 
 He wanna hot stuff 
 Hot love 
 Making it wet 
 He wanna give hot, jump shot 
 Groove to the left 
 He wanna time bump 
 Slam dunk, hump, hump, hump 
 Hoo 
 Hee (Keep it goin') 
 Party down
