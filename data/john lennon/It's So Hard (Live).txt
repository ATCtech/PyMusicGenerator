You got to live 
 You got to love you got to be 
 Somebody you got to shove 
 But it's so hard, it's really hard 
 Sometimes I feel like going 
 Down 
 You got to eat 
 You got to drink 
 You got to worry 
 It's so hard, it's really hard 
 Sometimes I feel like going 
 Down 
 But when it's good it's oh so 
 Good 
 And when I hold you in 
 Arms baby 
 Sometimes I feel like going 
 Down 
 You got to run 
 You got to hide 
 You got to keep your woman 
 Satisfied 
 But it's so hard, it's really hard 
 Sometimes I feel like going 
 Down
