 About leaving, leaving me behind, 
 Oh, you'd better bring it to me, 
 Bring your sweet lovin', 
 Bring it on home to me.

 Oh, you'd better bring it to me, 
 Bring your sweet lovin', 
 Bring it on home to me. 
 Yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Oh, you'd better bring it to me, 
 Bring your sweet lovin', 
 Bring it on home to me. 
 Yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah. 
 You know I'll always be your slave, 
 Until I'm dead and buried in my grave. 
 Oh, you'd better bring it to me, 
 Bring your sweet lovin', 
 Bring it on home to me. 
 Yeah, (yeah) yeah, yeah
