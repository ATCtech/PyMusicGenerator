So long! 
 Been a long year! 
 Doo-doo-doo-doo... 
 All right! 
 "It's all down to goodnight vienna. 
 I'd like to say hi to ringo, paul, and george... how are you? 
 Ev'rybody back home in England... what's cookin'?" 
 Doo-doo-doo, hey hey. 
 Darlin', I would beg on my bending knees! 
 Baby... you're so smart. 
 I want permission... 
 ??? 
 Little by little by little by little... 
 I need your love so bad it hurts me.
