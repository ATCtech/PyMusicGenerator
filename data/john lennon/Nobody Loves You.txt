Nobody loves you when you're down and out, 
 Nobody sees you when you're on cloud nine. 
 Ev'rybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime, 
 I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine. 
 Well, I've been across to the other side, 
 I've shown you ev'rything, I got nothing to hide. 
 But still you ask me, do I love you? 
 What it is? What it is? 
 All I can show you is it's all show biz, 
 All I can tell you is it's all show biz. 
 Nobody loves you when you're down and out, 
 Nobody knows you when you're on cloud nine. 
 Ev'rybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime, 
 I'll scratch your back and you knife mine. 
 Been across the water now so many times, 
 I've seen the one-eyed witchdoctor leading the blind. 
 But still you ask me, do I love you? 
 What you say? What you say? 
 Ev'ry time I put my finger on it, it slips away, 
 Ev'ry time I put my finger on it, it slips away. 
 What you say? What you say? What you say? 
 Well, I get up in the morning 
 And I'm looking in the mirror to see, ooh-wee! 
 Then I'm lying in the darkness 
 And I know I can't get to sleep, ooh-wee! 
 Nobody loves you when you're old and grey, 
 Nobody needs you when you're upside down. 
 Ev'rybody's hollerin' 'bout their own birthday, 
 Ev'rybody loves you when you're six foot in the ground
