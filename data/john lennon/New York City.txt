Standing on the corner, just me and Yoko Ono 
 We was waiting for Jerry to land 
 Up come a man with a guitar in his hand 
 Singing, "Have a marijuana if you can" 
 His name was David Peel and we found that he was real 
 He sang, "The Pope smokes dope every day" 
 Up come a policeman shoved us up the street 
 Singing, "Power to the people today" 
 New York City 
 New York City 
 New York City 
 Que pasa, New York? 
 Que pasa, New York? 
 Well, down to Max's Kansas City, got down the nitty gritty 
 With the Elephants Memory Band 
 Laid something down as the news spread around 
 About the Plastic Ono Elephants Memory Band 
 And we played some funky boogie and laid some tutti-frutti 
 Singing, "Long Tall Sally's a man" 
 Up come a preacher-man trying to be a teacher 
 Singing, "God's a red herring in drag"

 Well, we did the Staten Island Ferry, making movies for the telly 
 Played the Fillmore and Apollo for freedom 
 Tried to shake our image, just a cycling through the Village 
 But found that we had left it back in London 
 Well, nobody came to bug us, hustle us or shove us 
 We decided to make it our home 
 If the Man wants to shove us out, we gonna jump and shout 
 The Statue of Liberty said, "Come"
