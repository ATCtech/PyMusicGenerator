One, two, three, four 
 All right, all right 
 Whatever gets you through the night 
 It's all right, all right 
 It's your money or your life 
 It's all right, all right 
 Don't need a sword to cut through flowers 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Whatever gets you through your life 
 It's all right, all right 
 Doin' wrong, doin' wrong, do it right 
 It's all right, all right 
 Don't need a watch to waste your time 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Listen, listen 
 Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me 
 I won't do you no harm 
 Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me 
 Come on, listen to me, listen, listen, listen 
 All right 
 Whatever gets you to the light 
 It's all right, it's all right 
 Out the blue or out of sight 
 It's all right, all right 
 Don't need a gun to blow your mind 
 Oh no, no no, no no 
 Listen 
 Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me 
 I won't do you no harm 
 Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me 
 Come on, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me 
 All right 
 Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it right 
 Doin' it right, doin' it right 
 Stop
