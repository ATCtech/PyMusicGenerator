It ain't fair, John Sinclair 
 In the stir for breathing air 
 Won't you care for John Sinclair? 
 In the stir for breathing air 
 Let him be, set him free 
 Let him be like you and me 
 They gave him ten for two 
 And what else can the judges do? 
 We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free 
 If he'd been a soldier man 
 Shooting gooks in Vietnam 
 If he was the CIA 
 Selling dope and making hay 
 He'd be free, they'd let him be 
 Breathing air like you and me, right on 
 They gave him ten for two 
 What else can the judges do? 
 We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free 
 They gave him ten for two 
 They got old Lee Otis too 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta set him free 
 Was he jailed for what he done? 
 Or representing everyone 
 Free John now, if we can 
 From the clutches of the man 
 Let him be, lift the lid 
 Bring him to his wife and kids, alright 
 They gave him ten for two 
 What else can the bastards do? 
 We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta 
 Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free
