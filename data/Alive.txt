My mother told me I should go and get some therapy   I asked the doctor can you find out what is wrong with me?   I dont know why I wanna be with every girl I meet   I cant control it   Yeah I know its taking over me   Im going crazy   Cant contain it   So tell me just what I should do oh   She said hey its alright   Does it make you feel alive?   Dont look back   Live your life   Even if its only for tonight   She said hey its alright   If it makes you feel alive   Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me   I met a girl I took her end up to the balcony   I whispered something in her ear that I just cant repeat   She said okay but she was worried what her friends will think   Shes going crazy   Cant contain it   She asked me what should I do?   I said hey its alright   Does it make you feel alive?   Dont look back   Live your life   Even if its only for tonight   I said hey its alright   If it makes you feel alive   We got to live before we get older   Do what we like   We got nothing to lose   Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders   We got nothing to prove   I said hey its alright   Does it make you feel alive?   Dont look back   Live your life   Even if its only for tonight   I said hey its alright   Does it make you feel alive?   Dont look back   Live your life   Even if its only for tonight   I said hey its alright   If it makes you feel alive
