She was there screaming   Beating her voice in her doom   But nobody came too soon   A fall down the stairs   Her dress torn   Oh the blood in her hair   A mystery so sullen in air   She lie there so tenderly   Fashioned so slenderly   Lift her with care   Oh the blood in her hair   Everyone came to see   The girl that now is dead   So blind stare the eyes in her head   And suddenly a voice from the crowd said   This girl lived in vain   Her face bear such agony such strain   But only the man from next door   Knew Little Susie and how he cried   As he reached down   To close Susies eyes   She lie there so tenderly   Fashioned so slenderly   Lift her with care   Oh the blood in her hair   It was all for Gods sake   For her singing the tune   For someone to feel her despair   To be damned to know hoping is dead and youre doomed   Then to scream out   And nobodys there   She knew no one cared   Father left home poor mother died   Leaving Susie alone   Grandfathers soul too had flown   No one to care   Just to love her   How much can one bear   Neglecting the needs in her prayers   Neglection can kill   Like a knife in your soul   Oh it will   Little Susie fought so hard to live   She lie there so tenderly   Fashioned so slenderly   Lift her with care   So young and so fairI dont wanna move when Im in her hands   Theres nothing I can do or say Uh   Put everything on hold Cancel all

loveAlone she lays waiting   Surrounded by gloom   Inflated by shadows   Painting the room   The light from the window   Cuts trough the air   And pins the child lying there   Scared of the moon   She pulls up the curtain   And shivers in fright   She hides from the colours   That rides on the night   The light through the window   That lights up the sky   And causes her moanfull cry   Scared of the moon   Theres nothing wrong   Dont be bothered they said   Its just childish fantasies turning your head   No need to worry   Its really too soon   But there she lies shivering   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   The years go by swiftly   And soon childhood ends   But life is still fearful   When evening descends   The fear of a child   Still intrude the night   Returning on beams of light   Scared of the moon   The feeling of terror   She felt as a youth   Has turned from a fantasy   Into the truth   The moon is the enemy   Twisting her soul   And taking its fearful tone   Scared of the moon   But now there are others who sit here alone   And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom   Together they gather   The loners see shade   But knowing just why theyre scared   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moon   Scared of the moonYou are the promised kiss of springtime   That makes the lonely winter seem long   You are the breathless hush of evening   That trembles on the brink of a lovely song   You are the angel glow that lights a star   The dearest things I know are what you are   Some day my happy arms will hold you   And some day Ill know that moment divine   When all the things you are are mine   You are the angel glow that lights a star

I cant believe that you are here and lying next to me   Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined   Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine?

And tender touches just to show you how I feel   Or should I act all cool like it was no big deal?

now youre gone   You made me love you   And oh my darling now youre gone   You said loving you   Would make life beautiful   With each passing day   But as soon as love came   Into my heart   You turned and you walked   Just walked away   spoken:   You stripped me of my dreams   You gave me faith then you took my hope   Look at me now   Look at me   See what loving has done to me   Look at my face   See how cryin has left its trace   After you made me all your own   Then you left me all alone   You made your words sound so sweet   Knowing that your love I couldnt keep   spoken:   My heart cries out for your tuch   But baby youre not there   And the lonely cry fades in the air   Love is here   And oh my darling now youre gone   Love is here   And oh my darling now youre gone   You made
